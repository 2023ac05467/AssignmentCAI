Scope 2 due to the underlying leasing model and SAP’s operational control over the IT infrastructure.

Report by the Supervisory
Board
Dear Shareholders,
In the following, we would like to inform you about the work of the Supervisory Board in the fiscal year
2023.
Collaboration Between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board
In the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE discharged the duties imposed on it by the law
and by the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. It advised the Executive Board on an ongoing basis
with regard to the running of the Company and it scrutinized and monitored the work of management.
The Supervisory Board received regular, full, and timely reports from the Executive Board, both from
members in person and in written documents. The Supervisory Board was also in regular exchange
with senior internal officers through its various committees. This ensured that we were always up to
date, even between meetings, on the Company’s strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk
management, compliance (in other words, adherence to laws, to the Company's Articles of
Incorporation, and to internal policies), and on transactions of special significance for SAP. In its reports,
the Executive Board also informed us in particular where business deviated from plan or target, and
why. We questioned and probed the Executive Board’s reports to satisfy ourselves that the information
it gave us was plausible. The Executive Board fully met our requirements when it came to providing
information.
In addition, the Supervisory Board chairperson and the CEO were in continuous contact, which meant
the Supervisory Board chairperson was always apprised without delay of all important events that
were significant for assessing SAP’s situation and progress or for the management and governance of
the Company. Moreover, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the CEO regularly discussed
matters related to SAP’s strategy, business performance, risk position, risk management, and
compliance. In preparation for the upcoming handover of the Supervisory Board chair position, the
deputy chairperson representing the shareholder representatives was increasingly included in these
discussions.
Transactions that were submitted to us because they required the approval of the Supervisory Board
whether by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Supervisory Board’s list of transactions requiring its
consent, were approved by us after detailed examination and discussion with the Executive Board.
Supervisory Board Meetings and Resolutions
In the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE held four ordinary meetings and three
extraordinary meetings at which we deliberated and resolved on all matters of relevance to the
Company. Our plenary meetings and committee meetings were held as physical meetings, as video or
telephone conferences, or as hybrid sessions, where some members attended physically and the
remainder online. We also adopted 15resolutions by correspondence vote. The following table
provides an overview of the individual members’ attendance at the Supervisory Board’s plenary
sessions and committee meetings in the year under review. This report also contains a table that
shows which meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were held as a physical meeting,
as a video or telephone conference, or as a hybrid session.

1 Currently not a member of any Supervisory Board committee
The Supervisory Board and its committees also regularly convened wholly or partly without the
Executive Board as necessary to deliberate on matters that pertained to the Executive Board, required
internal discussion among Supervisory Board members alone or did not require the Executive Board’s
presence, or to facilitate discussion between the Supervisory Board or its respective committee and
the auditor without the Executive Board present. This was the case in three of the plenary sessions and
in eight committee meetings in 2023. In addition, the shareholder representatives and the employee
representatives independently discussed, at times with the CEO, the topics on the respective agenda
before each ordinary meeting. Said deliberations similarly took place as required prior to the
extraordinary meetings or prior to circular correspondence votes. The Supervisory Board addressed
the following key topics during the year:
Artificial intelligence
One of the main focuses of our discussions with the Executive Board was the topic of artificial
intelligence (“AI”). SAP is working intensively to integrate AI in its software solutions to allow customers
to reap the enormous potential of using AI. The Supervisory Board supports and continually monitors
this process and the measures associated with it. At our meeting on February 22, 2023, for example,
the Technology and Strategy Committee reported on how the Executive Board had explained SAP’s AI
strategy and its bearing on SAP’s product portfolio to it. When the Supervisory Board met on
April 13, 2023, the Executive Board presented the Company’s innovation plans in the field of AI and
outlined how SAP would integrate certain AI applications into its products. Our plenary session and
committee meetings in July 2023 were held in San Martin, California, USA. These sessions and the
supporting program likewise dealt with AI, and included expert presentations covering various aspects
of this technology. When the Technology and Strategy Committee met in July 2023, it reviewed the
16/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
implementation of SAP’s enterprise AI strategy and examined the framework conditions for data
consumption by AI applications. SAP’s AI strategy was also the subject of intense debate at the plenary
meeting in July 2023. Among other things, our discussions focused on the go-to-market strategy and
SAP’s current and future investments to expand its AI portfolio. In addition, management explained to
us its plans for building up additional AI expertise among SAP’s workforce. The Go-to-Market and
Operations Committee analyzed the success of the go-to-market measures for AI at its October
meeting.
Cloud Transformation
SAP’s transformation to a cloud company continued to be the subject of ongoing dialog between the
Executive Board and Supervisory Board in 2023. We consulted in-depth with the Executive Board on
the key initiatives and measures in the Company’s cloud transformation strategy and monitored its
implementation. In our April meeting, we examined the challenges in public cloud. When it met in
October, the Finance and Investment Committee reviewed SAP’s strategy to realign the product and
service portfolio and discussed the cloud gross margin with the Executive Board. The Go-To-Market
and Operations Committee likewise dealt with the cloud transformation in the reporting year,
specifically the go-to-market strategy and related sales model. In our plenary session on
October 26, 2023, the full Supervisory Board and the Executive Board reviewed in-depth the planned
second phase of the cloud transformation, including the related goals and implementation measures.
In this connection, we also discussed with the Executive Board its proposals for a new Executive Board
structure, which it deemed necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the next phase of
the transformation and the proposed efficiency measures. The Supervisory Board places great
importance on being fully informed about the further cloud transformation, so that it can constructively
support its implementation.
New Government Security Committee
The rise in legal requirements in the context of national security and geopolitical developments are
becoming increasingly important for SAP as a software provider for the public sector and as an
operator of critical infrastructures. The Supervisory Board discussed, on several occasions in 2023,
matters relating to the national security of states in which SAP is subject to corresponding regulations.
From the Supervisory Board’s perspective, it was essential that a committee on government security
be set up to reflect SAP’s business activities in these security-sensitive areas. The Supervisory Board
will therefore, in accordance with the legal framework, accompany and monitor these specific
Company activities by means of a dedicated committee going forward. The Personnel and Governance
Committee discussed the formation of and rules of procedure for this committee at its April 12 and
July 26, 2023, meetings and thereafter reported on its deliberations to the full Supervisory Board. The
new six-member Government Security Committee was subsequently established, its rules of
procedure adopted, and its members elected during the October meeting of the Supervisory Board.
The Committee began its work in January 2024.
Sustainability
Due to the comprehensive strategic importance that sustainability has for SAP and its customers, the
Supervisory Board addressed the sustainability aspects that are relevant to SAP numerous times
throughout the fiscal year 2023. It is important to note here that SAP promotes sustainability in two
different ways: by offering solutions that empower SAP customers to become more sustainable
enterprises, and by aligning its own business activities with ESG (environmental, social, and
governance) goals and targets. The entire spectrum of SAP’s sustainability efforts and sustainability
solutions is a cross topic that is monitored and covered by several committees. That is why the
Supervisory Board has not formed a pure ESG or sustainability committee. By continuously addressing
sustainability issues both in plenary sessions and in the committees, we have been able to build
extensive expertise in this area: specifically, the Audit and Compliance Committee monitored the
sustainability reporting and the way the reports are created and managed, and the Personnel and
Governance Committee dealt with sustainability targets relevant to Executive Board compensation.
The Technology and Strategy Committee, meanwhile, concerned itself with sustainability-related
products and software as well as IT security, whereas the People and Culture Committee addressed
17/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
sustainability as it relates to social issues. On top of this, the full Supervisory Board was updated on
SAP’s current sustainability portfolio and the planned expansion of this product range at its meeting in
April. As part of the October meeting, the Supervisory Board had the opportunity to examine the topic
of sustainability at SAP based on a detailed meeting document that highlighted, in particular, SAP’s
goal to emit zero greenhouse gas emissions from 2030 onwards, general human rights topics, the
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, and best practices for responsible AI.
Other key topics addressed at our meetings in 2023 notably included the following:
Meeting in February (Meeting to Discuss the Financial Statements)
At our ordinary Supervisory Board meeting on February 22, 2023, we adopted the resolutions required
under the current Executive Board compensation package for fiscal 2022 and 2023. To this end, we first
determined performance against the defined target for the short-term incentive (STI) 2022, and then
set the performance targets for the STI 2023. In addition, we resolved the individual allocation amount
for the 2023 tranche of the long-term incentive (LTI) 2020. Finally, we evaluated the appropriateness of
the Executive Board members’ compensation for 2022, and in each case found it to be appropriate in
terms of amount, structure, objective criteria, and reasonable and appropriate in relation to the
Company's circumstances, also in regard to its profit and outlook. We referred in this regard to a
certificate obtained beforehand from an independent compensation consultant. For more information
about the STI 2022 and 2023, the LTI 2020, and the other compensation elements for Executive Board
members, see the Compensation Report.
We also discussed the upcoming reappointments of, and thus renewals of the contracts with, Julia
White, Sabine Bendiek, and Scott Russell at this meeting. In this connection, the Supervisory Board
chairperson reported that Sabine Bendiek would not be standing for a further term of office. We
thereafter resolved to offer both Scott Russell and Julia White reappointment and renewal of their
Executive Board contracts by a further three years until 2027, and to negotiate new contracts with
them. We also concerned ourselves with succession planning for Sabine Bendiek.
Next, we passed the proposed resolutions for the SAP SE Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on
May 11, 2023. In particular, these proposals included the proposed election of Punit Renjen as a new
Supervisory Board member with the intention of establishing him as a successor to the Supervisory
Board chair, and the re-election of Jennifer Li and Qi Lu. The auditor for the 2023 financial year had
already been elected by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 18, 2022, in view of the
upcoming change of auditor, which is why there was no proposal for a resolution in this regard. Further,
we received an Executive Board report on business in 2022 and adopted the budget for 2023 after
discussing same extensively with the Executive Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board turned its
recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee, we approved the audit and gave our
consent to the financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2022.,In addition, we
endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings for 2022,
and approved the compensation report for fiscal 2022. Beyond this, the Executive Board gave us an
Extraordinary Meeting in March
We held an extraordinary meeting on March 12, 2023, to discuss the sale already underway of SAP’s
interest in Qualtrics International Inc. (“Qualtrics”), a U.S.-listed company. The Executive Board and the
Finance and Investment Committee explained the economic background of this move to us. In
preparation for this meeting, we obtained written answers to questions the Supervisory Board
members had submitted in advance regarding the sale of Qualtrics. We ultimately approved the
divestiture on recommendation of the Finance and Investment Committee.
Meeting in April
On April 13, 2023, we discussed the aforementioned key topics as well as business in the first quarter,
the Executive Board reporting particularly on SAP’s competitive position and on the current tasks in the
individual Executive Board portfolios.

Extraordinary Meeting in May
The Supervisory Board held an extraordinary meeting following the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders on May 11, 2023. After welcoming the newly-elected member Punit Renjen, we
appointed him as second deputy chairperson of the Supervisory Board and, due to the new election
or re-election of the Supervisory Board members concerned, approved the proposed changes to the
composition of the committees. The Executive Board then explained to us the planned adjustments to
the Company’s 2025 financial ambition, which was announced at the SAP Sapphire customer event in
Orlando, and the expectations of investors in this regard. Next, the Executive Board presented its
proposal to establish a €5 billion share buyback program that would run until the end of 2025.
According to the proposal, the program would be carried out on the basis of the appropriate
authorization by the Annual General Meeting, and various intra-group financing measures would be
undertaken to implement it. After joint deliberation, we approved the Executive Board’s proposal. As
the last item on the agenda, we discussed how to deal with potential fines against SAP in connection
with ongoing compliance investigations, when it came to the compensation of the Executive Board
members currently in office. We particularly took into account that the compliance incidents in
question had occurred before the current members of the Executive Board were appointed. The
Supervisory Board’s investigations into these compliance incidents therefore do not pertain to current
Executive Board members.
Meeting in July
As previously mentioned above, AI was a key topic in our July meeting. The Executive Board also
reported on business in the second quarter, and we discussed with management potential markets to
focus on in future and various marketing-related matters. Next, an analyst from a U.S. investment
management company explained the difference between SAP and other major software companies
from his perspective as an analyst and the main criteria he used to arrive at this opinion. Based on this
information, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board then discussed the strategic direction of
the Company with the goal of better meeting the capital markets’ expectations. In addition, the Audit
and Compliance Committee and the law firm tasked by the Supervisory Board updated us on the
ongoing compliance matters, particularly the negotiations with the U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and informed us on how to proceed. We also
approved an amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board to include rules on
dealing with conflicts of interests, and passed two resolutions on Executive Board compensation
serving to neutralize the impact of the Qualtrics sale on the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
STI 2023 and for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 tranches of the LTI 2020.
Meeting in October
At our meeting on October 26, 2023, the individual Executive Board members first reported on
business performance in the third quarter for their respective Board area. Next, we took an in-depth
look at SAP’s transformation, focusing on the goals, the measures planned by the Executive Board to
improve the process, and the new structure of responsibilities at Executive Board level. The
Supervisory Board thereafter discussed various HR and compensation matters without the Executive
Board being present. Topics notably included the adjustment of Executive Board service contracts to
the new compensation system, and the adoption of a clawback policy, which standardizes the cases in
which the Company can reclaim variable compensation already paid out to certain top executives,
including members of the Executive Board. SAP was required to adopt and implement this directive by
December 31, 2023, due to new regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
Going forward, the new clawback policy will complement the clawback provisions that already exist in
the Executive Board contracts. We then dealt with the regular review of the independence of the
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Based on the findings from our own
examination, we determined that all shareholder representatives were independent in the meaning of
the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and were therefore to be named as such in the
Corporate Governance Statement. We also ascertained –in accordance with the recommendations in
the GCGC – that more than half of the shareholder representatives are independent from the
Company and the Executive Board. Thereafter, we resolved on what we believe to be the appropriate
number of independent shareholder representative members, and determined that the Supervisory
19/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Board has an appropriate number of independent members in the meaning of the GCGC, also when
the shareholder structure is taken into account. Lastly, the Supervisory Board adopted the regular
declaration of compliance and approved an amendment to the non-IFRS definition for the financial
year 2024.
Extraordinary Meeting in December
An extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting was held on December 10, 2023, during which the
Supervisory Board focused on the forthcoming settlement agreements with the U.S. Department of
Justice (U.S. DOJ), the SEC, and the South Africa National Prosecution Authority in relation to the
compliance violations in South Africa and other countries. The Supervisory Board gave its consent to
the detailed content of the settlement agreements negotiated with the said authorities at the meeting.
Resolutions by Correspondence Vote
We adopted, besides the above resolutions, several resolutions by correspondence which the
relevant Committees had deliberated on in advance and recommended to us, as follows:
– February: Approval of the Corporate Governance Statement for 2022
– March: Reappointment of Scott Russell and Julia White for a further three years until the end of
January 2027 and February 2027, respectively, and agreement to the terms and conditions of their

effect of potential fines on Executive Board members’ compensation; c) Resolution on the
associated declaration of compliance for 2022; d) Resolutions on changes to the composition of
the Nomination Committee and the Go-To-Market and Operations Committee
– October: Approval of a long-term collaboration contract as part of SAP’s sponsoring activities
– November: Resolution on applying a new non-IFRS definition to Executive Board compensation
as of January 1, 2024, whereby the still-pending LTI tranches 2022 and 2023 remain unaffected
and are to be calculated according to the previous non-IFRS definition.
– December: Resolution to eliminate the impact of the LeanIX acquisition on the KPIs for the
STI 2023 and for the tranches 2021, 2022, and 2023 of the LTI 2020

The Work of the Supervisory Board Committees
The committees made a key contribution to the work of the Supervisory Board in 2023, notably by
preparing relevant agenda items and resolutions for Supervisory Board meetings, by approving
resolution proposals, and by regularly reporting on their deliberations and on their decisions taken.
The following committees were in place in the year under review:
Personnel and Governance Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, Finance and Investment
Committee, Technology and Strategy Committee, People and Culture Committee, Nomination
Committee, Go-To-Market and Operations Committee
Each of the aforementioned committees was active in 2023. For more information about the
Supervisory Board committees, particularly their respective composition, tasks, and responsibilities,
see the Corporate Governance Statement and the Corporate Governance section of SAP’s Web site.
Besides the matters described above, the committees focused primarily on the following topics in
2023:
– The Personnel and Governance Committee held six meetings in the reporting year. In particular,
the Committee, in fulfillment of the tasks assigned to it, extensively prepared the Supervisory
Board’s deliberations and resolutions described above on Executive Board compensation and on
the new Government Security Committee, and approved resolution proposals. The Committee
adopted a total of three resolutions by correspondence vote. In two sessions in January 2023, the
Committee dealt with the renewal of Scott Russell and Julia White’s Executive Board contracts,
and with the introduction of compensation for the Lead Independent Director after it had become
apparent that this role involves considerable additional time and effort. In addition, the Committee
consented to the secondary employment of an Executive Board member and examined the
German Federal Labor Court’s ruling on SAP’s Employee Involvement Agreement. The Committee
approved, by way of correspondence vote, the conclusion of a consulting contract by Luka Mucic.
was to remain a member of the Qualtrics Executive Board until SAP had fully divested Qualtrics.
The consulting contract was to serve as the legal basis for this membership. When it met in April,
the Committee resolved an update to the contractual non-compete clause in Executive Board
contracts that was to be introduced in connection with the conversion of those contracts to the
new compensation system. In addition, the Committee dealt with the search for candidates to
replace Sabine Bendiek as head of the Executive Board’s HR portfolio. The Committee
subsequently agreed on the candidate proposed by the Supervisory Board for this portfolio when
it met in July. As well as discussing various compensation matters, the Committee's
October 25, 2023, meeting focused particularly on a change in the non-IFRS definition for fiscal
2024 and on the creation of a new Supervisory Board office. The Committee also held an
21/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
extraordinary meeting on December 6, 2023, to deliberate on the candidate to be proposed to
the Supervisory Board as a new Executive Board member for the Product & Engineering area. It
came to the conclusion that Muhammad Alam was its favorite candidate. In January 2024, the
Committee prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolution to elect Muhammad Alam to the
Executive Board effective April 1, 2024, once the details of his Executive Board contract had been
negotiated. The proposed resolution took into account the new SAP Executive Board structure
that was announced on January 9, 2024.
– The Audit and Compliance Committee held 12 meetings in 2023 – two of which jointly with the
Finance and Investment Committee and two jointly with the Technology and Strategy Committee.
Said schedule included one telephone conference per quarter to vote on the quarterly reporting,
and one session per quarter to address regular and topical agenda items. In addition, in
November and December 2023, the Committee resolved both times internally on the System and
Organization Controls (SOC). The SOC involves software-related certifications and risk analyses
that enable companies to conduct an impartial investigation in accordance with a framework
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which the
companies and their customers both require in the context of their financial reporting. In its
ordinary meetings, the Committee also had the opportunity to engage with the auditor without the
Executive Board present, which was an integral part of the meeting agenda. The Committee
comprehensively prepared the resolutions of the Supervisory Board for all topics assigned to it,
as described above. Regular agenda items included the course of business in the respective
quarter, the accounting processes, the preparation of end-of-quarter closings, and the quarterly
reports due for publication. In addition, the Committee chairperson was in regular contact with the
auditor. Other recurring meeting topics included the monitoring of SAP’s risk management system,
internal control system, non-financial reporting, and compliance system (including specific
compliance issues, the status of corresponding SAP-internal investigations, and case-related
collaboration with authorities). The Committee also dealt regularly with the monitoring of SAP’s
cybersecurity processes that the Executive Board had established and continually optimizes to
ensure compliance of all activities in this area. At its February 2023 meeting, the Committee
prepared the Supervisory Board’s resolutions on the financial statements of SAP SE and the
adopted by the Supervisory Board at the audit meeting. Other material topics dealt with by the
Committee beyond the regular meeting topics in its ordinary meetings and those described in the
“Sustainability” section of this report included quarter-specific matters and the amendments to
the non-IFRS definition for fiscal 2024. Further, the Committee monitored the progress of selected
lawsuits involving SAP. The Audit and Compliance Committee also received regular updates on
how BDO AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (BDO) was performing its tasks as the new auditor
for SAP’s financial statements and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Committee
continually monitored the quality of the auditor and the management report. To this end – in
addition to evaluating satisfaction surveys for the prior year’s audit by the previous auditor – the
Committee obtained and referred to the report from the current auditor on its internal quality
assurance standards and to any material findings from internal quality audits, external quality
controls, and peer reviews, and from any investigations conducted by the government or
regulators into the auditor's audits. At its meeting in July, the Committee discussed the audit focus
for 2023 with the auditor. As reported in more detail below, the Committee also held two joint
meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee in February and December 2023 to discuss
the Group annual plan for 2023 and the preliminary Group annual plan for 2024. The joint
meetings with the Technology and Strategy Committee in April and October focused on SAP’s
cybersecurity framework, which had been enhanced based on the results of the assessment by
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, a department of the U.S. Department of
Commerce). Beyond this, the Committees reviewed the status of the SOC certifications for fiscal
2023, and the Audit and Compliance Committee approved the certification services to be
provided by BDO. The auditor attended the Audit and Compliance Committee meetings except
for the joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and
Strategy Committee, and reported in depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of
selected cloud and software agreements.

– The Finance and Investment Committee held four regular meetings and four extraordinary
meetings in 2023. In addition, it held a joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in
February 2023 and again in December 2023. The Committee devoted considerable time at
several meetings to discussing business development and investor relations, and to discussing an
analysis of management efficiency. At an extraordinary meeting in January 2023, the Committee
and the Executive Board examined the different options for selling SAP’s interest in Qualtrics. In
the joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee in February 2023, the members of
both Committees discussed the annual budget for 2023 and recommended its approval to the
Supervisory Board. In the Finance and Investment Committee meeting that followed, the
members were updated on the Group’s liquidity situation and on productivity in the development
organization. The Committee held an extraordinary meeting in March where, after careful
consideration, it resolved to recommend the divestiture of Qualtrics to the Supervisory Board. At
its meeting in April, the Committee and the Executive Board discussed selected capital market
topics. In addition, the Committee was updated on the investments in the venture capital area,
which were being carried out in cooperation with the fund manager Sapphire Ventures, and the
strategic aspects of these activities. It also reviewed SAP’s product strategy and the management
of SAP’s product portfolio. In July, the Committee discussed SAP’s global strategy for the use and
expansion of its data centers, as well as SAP’s sovereign cloud offerings and share-based
compensation plans. Beyond this, the Executive Board reported on selected RISE with SAP
contracts as well as the strategy to extend existing customer contracts, and gave the Committee
members advance notice of the Company’s plans to acquire LeanIX, a provider of cloud-based IT
management software. The Committee deliberated on this acquisition at length at its meeting in
September, where it subsequently resolved its recommendation to the Supervisory Board. At its
October meeting, the Committee discussed key treasury topics. In December 2023, the
Committee held a second joint meeting with the Audit and Compliance Committee, at which the
Executive Board presented the preliminary Group annual plan for 2024. This meeting was held in
preparation for the Supervisory Board meeting in February 2024, at which the full Supervisory
Board resolved to approve the Group annual plan for 2024.
– The Technology and Strategy Committee held six meetings in 2023, which included two joint
meetings with the Audit and Compliance Committee as described above. The Committee
discussed the outlook for key technology trends in the software industry in the years to come and
SAP’s corporate and product strategies. At the February meeting, the Executive Board presented
management’s strategy for the Customer Experience product segment – which encompasses
everything an organization does to deliver superior customer outcomes – placing particular focus
on customer relationship management (CRM) and SAP’s various analytics applications in this
domain. In April, the Committee turned its attention to SAP’s solutions for business network growth
areas, business process optimization, and sustainability. In October 2023, the Committee dealt
with matters related to data integration and data management, and reviewed the Company’s
innovation strategy for SAP Datasphere and the product’s generative AI capabilities. At their joint
meeting in October 2023, the Finance and Investment Committee and the Technology and
Strategy Committee deliberated on cybersecurity and the priorities to be set for it.
– The People and Culture Committee met four times in the reporting year. At its February meeting,
the Committee deliberated at length on the results of the employee survey that had been
conducted in the fall of 2022, notably those relating to employee engagement, as well as
feedback about management, and discussed the measures to be derived from this insight as a
result. Beyond this, it focused on SAP’s training business, which had undergone a radical
transformation since 2021 aimed at reaching one million active users by the end of 2023. In March,
the Committee looked at the progress made in the initiative to promote a standardized
performance management concept that supports the envisioned performance-based
compensation and incentive system and integrated planning of annual targets for employees. In
July 2023, the managers responsible for the People Compliance process at SAP introduced
themselves to the Committee and, after explaining that the focus of their efforts was on preventing
employee misconduct vis-à-vis others, gave an in-depth overview of the underlying compliance
processes and related information. Another topic of interest at this meeting was the progress
being made in strategic personnel planning. The Committee was presented in this regard with a
detailed overview of the past and expected demographic development of the SAP SE workforce,
23/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
and discussed the skills and expertise the Company would require of employees in the future.
When it met in October, the Committee revisited the topic of performance management,
particularly in view of the upcoming global rollout of the new concept. Moreover, the Committee
discussed SAP’s plans to require more in-office presence of its staff.
– The Nomination Committee met five times in 2023. On January 15, 2023, for example, the
Committee discussed potential candidates for election to the Supervisory Board by the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2023. In particular, the Committee members discussed
the potential successor to Hasso Plattner as Supervisory Board chairperson, ultimately deciding
that Punit Renjen was their preferred candidate. When it met again on January 25, the Committee
resolved its final recommendation to the Supervisory Board to elect Jennifer Li, Qi Lu, and Punit
Renjen to the Supervisory Board. Since four Supervisory Board members will reach the end of
their term of office in 2024, the Committee spent its August 2023 meeting deliberating on
candidates for re-election or election as new members. It also discussed the skills that Hasso
Plattner’s successor should possess, and agreed that the person should have extensive
technology knowledge. Based on the process it had agreed upon in August for nominating
candidates, the Committee met again in October 2023 to agree on how to approach the ones they
had shortlisted. On December 6, 2023, the Committee agreed on the candidates to be proposed
to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2024 for the Supervisory Board seat being
vacated by the departing Hasso Plattner.
– The Go-To-Market and Operations Committee likewise met four times in the reporting year. At the
Committee’s meeting in February, the Executive Board presented its marketing plans for
SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition as well as its planned changes to the internal go-to-market
concept for 2023 target achievement, particularly with regard to roles and incentives. In April 2023,
the Executive Board presented a plan designed to further improve the measurable usage of our
software by customers and simultaneously increase demand, especially in the cloud environment.
In addition, the largest planned events for the remainder of the year were presented. When the
Committee met in July 2023, the Executive Advisory Board, an advisory body comprised of
managers from more than 20 SAP customers from various regions and industries, presented
feedback on the customer journey – that is, on the individual phases that a customer goes
through before the purchase and until after the delivery of a product. In addition, the Executive
Board presented a growth plan aimed at boosting growth and ensuring constant pipeline
population – that is, the number of software sales that are lined up. The last item discussed at this
meeting was a status report presented on new customer acquisition, also in comparison to SAP’s
peers. The Committee’s meeting in October reviewed an update on the growth plan presented to
it in July and discussed the further expansion of SAP’s partner network.
The work of the committees and their regular reports in the plenary sessions ensured that we were
kept fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and were able to discuss them
thoroughly.
Conflicts of Interest
Members of the Supervisory Board and of the Executive Board had no conflicts of interest that
recommendations E.1 and E.2 of the CGCG require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Rather,
they were avoided by the Supervisory Board member concerned not taking part in the relevant
discussions or voting on the matter in question in the event of a possible, selective conflict of interest.
Insofar as Supervisory Board members hold executive positions in companies or have material equity
in companies that currently have business dealings with SAP, we do not see any impairment of their
independence. The scope of the business relationships in question is relatively small and, moreover,
the transactions take place at arm’s length.
Training and Professional Development
The members of the Supervisory Board were once again offered various training and professional
development opportunities throughout the year, with appropriate support from the Company. Where it
made sense, presentations and training offerings were recorded and placed on a specially configured
training platform to enable the remaining Supervisory Board members to take part in them as well. The
24/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
members of the Audit and Compliance Committee were invited to a short seminar in April 2023 on
“Current aspects of non-financial reporting.” In May 2023, a course on “Innovation at SAP” was offered
that focused on AI, large language models (models that are trained on huge data volumes), and on the
metaverse, a digital space that is created by interacting with virtual, augmented, and physical reality. In
November, several Supervisory Board members took part in a virtual deep dive on Customer
Experience at SAP. On-boarding courses and leaflets are available for new Supervisory Board
members to familiarize themselves with their tasks and responsibilities when they assume office. New
members also have the opportunity to meet individually with members of the Executive Board to
discuss the topics relevant to their new portfolio.
The Supervisory Board had proposed the appointment of BDO on the recommendation of the Audit
and Compliance Committee. Prior to the proposed resolution being put to the Annual General Meeting
of Shareholders, BDO had confirmed to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the Audit and
Compliance Committee that circumstances did not exist that might prejudice or raise any doubt
concerning its independence as the Company’s auditor. In that connection, BDO informed us of the
volume of the services that were not part of the audit which it had either provided to the Group in the
past year or was engaged to provide in the year to come. The Supervisory Board has agreed with BDO
that the auditor should report to the Supervisory Board and record in the auditor’s report any fact
found during the audit that is inconsistent with the declaration given by the Executive Board and the
Supervisory Board concerning implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code. BDO
examined the SAP SE financial statements prepared in accordance with the German Commercial
Code, the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as required by the German Commercial Code, section 315e, and the
combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report prepared in accordance with the German
Commercial Code, and certified them without qualification. The auditor thus confirmed that, in its
opinion and based on its audit in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the SAP SE
and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position, and
results of operations of SAP SE and the SAP Group. The auditor also confirmed that the combined
SAP SE and SAP Group management report is consistent with the corresponding financial statements
and as a whole gives a suitable view of the position of SAP SE and the SAP Group and of foreseeable
opportunities and risks. In accordance with section 317 (3a) of the German Commercial Code, the
auditor also examined and confirmed that the renderings of the financial statements, the management
report, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report contained in the
files submitted on an electronic data carrier, which can be accessed by the issuer on the secure client
portal, and prepared for the purposes of disclosure comply in all material respects with the
requirements of section 328 (1) of the German Commercial Code regarding the electronic reporting
format (“ESEF format”). BDO had completed its audit of SAP’s internal control over financial reporting
and certified without qualification that it complies with the applicable U.S. standards. The auditor
stated in its opinion that it considers SAP's internal controls with respect to the consolidated financial
statements to be effective in all material respects. Additionally, it provided assurance on the non-
financial declaration and the disclosures contained therein on the topics identified as material –
namely, the environment, employees, human rights, corruption and bribery, customer loyalty, and data
privacy and data security – in the combined management report, and on the separate examination of
the compensation report and review of selected qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures
outside of the financial statements and management report. All Audit and Compliance Committee
members and Supervisory Board members received – initially in the form of drafts that were identical
to the final documents – the documents concerning the financial statements mentioned above, the
audit reports prepared by BDO, and the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of
retained earnings in good time. On February 21, 2024, the Executive Board prepared the financial
consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report, and submitted them
without delay to the Supervisory Board.
25/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
The Executive Board explained the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group and its proposal
concerning the appropriation of retained earnings at the meeting of the Audit and Compliance
Committee on February 21, 2024 (based on the drafts identical to the final documents) and at the
meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 21, 2024. Members of the Executive Board answered
questions from the Committee and the Supervisory Board. At the Audit and Compliance Committee
meeting, they also explained the compensation report and the Annual Report on Form 20-F prepared
in accordance with the applicable U.S. standards.
After the Executive Board had explained them, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the
Supervisory Board reviewed the financial statement documents (based on drafts identical to the final
documents), taking BDO’s audit reports (or the drafts identical to the final documents) into account.
The Audit and Compliance Committee then passed the compensation report on to the Supervisory
Board for release. The representative of the auditor who attended presented full reports on the audit
and the results of the audit to the Audit and Compliance Committee and Supervisory Board meetings
and explained its audit reports (or final drafts thereof). The auditor also reported that it had not
identified any material weaknesses in SAP’s internal control and risk-management systems for financial
reporting. Both the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board asked detailed
questions about the form, scope, and results of the audit. The Audit and Compliance Committee
reported to the Supervisory Board on its own review of the financial statements of SAP SE and the
SAP Group, its discussions with the Executive Board and with the auditor, and its supervision of the
financial reporting process. It confirmed that, as part of its supervisory work, it had addressed the
SAP Group’s internal control, risk management, and internal auditing systems, and found the systems
to be effective.
The Committee also reported that BDO had told it that no circumstances had arisen that might give
cause for concern about BDO’s impartiality, and informed us about the services BDO had provided
that were not part of the audit. The Committee reported that it had examined the auditor's
independence, taking the non-audit services it had rendered into consideration, and stated that, in the
Committee’s opinion, the auditor possessed the required degree of independence and professional
qualification.
The Audit and Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board satisfied themselves that BDO had
conducted the audit properly. In particular, they concluded that both the audit reports and the audit
itself fulfilled the legal requirements. Based on the report and the Audit and Compliance Committee’s
recommendation, the Supervisory Board approved the results of the audit and, since there were no
findings from our own examination, we gave our consent to the SAP SE financial statements, the
consolidated financial statements, the combined Group management report, and adopted the
compensation report pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, section 162. The financial
statements and combined management report were thus formally adopted upon approval by the
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board’s opinion of the Company and the Group coincided with
that of the Executive Board as set out in the combined management report. The Supervisory Board
considered the proposal presented by the Executive Board concerning the appropriation of retained
earnings. We had regard to the requirements of dividends policy, the effects on the liquidity of SAP SE
and the SAP Group, and the interests of the shareholders. We also discussed these matters with the
auditor. We then endorsed the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of retained
earnings, in accordance with the Audit and Compliance Committee's recommendation. The corporate
governance statement pursuant to the German Commercial Code, sections 315d and 289f was
approved for publication by the Supervisory Board by way of correspondence vote prior to the
meeting to discuss the financial statements. Finally, we approved this present Report.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To SAP SE, Walldorf
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND OF THE COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT
REPORT
AUDIT OPINIONS
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of SAP SE, Walldorf, and its subsidiaries (the
Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2023,
and the consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the
financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In addition, we have audited the combined group management report (report on the position of the
accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the
combined group management report listed in section “OTHER INFORMATION”.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
– the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as well as adopted by the EU, and the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB
[Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at December 31,
2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to
December 31, 2023 and
– the accompanying combined group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view
of the group’s position. In all material respects, this combined group management report is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements
and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the
combined group management report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined
group management report listed in section “OTHER INFORMATION”.
Pursuant to § 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB (German Commercial Code), we declare that our audit has not
led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of
the combined group management report.
BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group
management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014,
referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the
“AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND OF THE COMBINED GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT” section of our auditor’s report. We are
independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German
29/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities
in accordance with these requirements.
In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) letter (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we
have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined group
management report.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to
December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a
separate audit opinion on these matters.
We have identified the following matters as key audit matters to be disclosed in our auditor’s report:
1. Cloud revenue recognition
2. Assessment of the Group’s uncertain tax treatments
3. Measurement of unlisted equity securities
CLOUD REVENUE RECOGNITION
Matter
The Group generated revenue in 2023 of EUR 31,207 million, of which EUR 13,664 million relate to
cloud revenues from fees earned from providing customers a cloud offering with software as a service,
platform as a service, infrastructure as a service and/or premium cloud support through subscriptions
for use of the Group’s cloud solutions. For most of the Group’s cloud offerings, measured both in
volume and number, the customer is entitled to continuously access and use one or more cloud
solutions for a specified term, therefore cloud revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus
ratably over the term of access. However, some cloud business models are provisioned on a
consumption basis where a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on cloud services throughout
the contract term, but with the discretion to call off cloud services on an as needed basis. For those
arrangements cloud revenue is recognized based on consumption as it best reflects the measure
towards satisfaction of the performance obligation(s).
The evaluation of cloud revenue contracts bears an inherent risk of errors due to the complex nature
of certain contracts. SAP defined detailed accounting policy guidelines in line with the applicable
accounting standards and has established uniform processes throughout the group to manage the
accounting for its cloud contracts. Applying them often requires significant management judgement, in
particular with respect to whether certain agreements with the same customer are economically linked
and need to be combined, whether the various services that are owed by the Group according to the
contract qualify as separate performance obligations, the allocation of the transaction price of a
customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone-selling prices
and the point in time at which the provision of services by the Group for the specific performance
obligation commences.
Cloud revenue recognition is a key audit matter due to the significance of the cloud revenue and the
high degree of complex judgement required.
The respective cloud revenue disclosures of the Group are contained in section “A.1

Usefulness of Non-IFRS Measures
We believe that our non-IFRS measures are useful to investors for the following reasons:
– Our expense (non-IFRS), and profit (non-IFRS) measures, along with the CCB measure (see above),
provide investors with insight into management’s decision-making because management uses these
measures to run our business and make financial, strategic, and operating decisions. We exclude
the expense adjustments outlined above when making decisions to allocate resources. In addition,
we use these non-IFRS measures to facilitate comparisons of SAP’s operating performance from
period to period.
– The non-IFRS measures provide investors with additional information that enables a comparison of
year-over-year operating performance by eliminating certain direct effects of acquisitions, share-
based compensation plans, restructuring plans, and regulatory compliance matters.
– Non-IFRS and non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures are widely used in
the software industry. In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS measures may facilitate comparison
with our competitors’ corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures.
Limitations of Non-IFRS Measures
Without being analyzed in conjunction with the corresponding IFRS measures, the non-IFRS measures
are not indicative of our present and future performance primarily for the following reasons:
– While our profit (non-IFRS) numbers reflect the elimination of certain acquisition-related expenses,
no eliminations are made for the additional revenue or other income that results from the
acquisitions.
– The acquisition-related amortization expense that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS)
numbers is a recurring expense that will impact our financial performance in future years.
– The remaining acquisition-related charges that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS)
numbers are likely to recur should SAP enter into business combinations in the future. Similarly, the
restructuring expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur
should SAP perform restructurings in the future.
– The expense adjustment for acquisition-related charges does not arise from a common conceptual
basis. This is because the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between post-
acquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should particularly be considered when
evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers, as these
combine our revenue and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual
basis.
– Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the
future.
– In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we
intend to continue doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring,
although the amounts usually change from period to period.
– Expenses ascribed to the regulatory compliance matters may include penalties and legal costs, all
of which would impact the operating cash flows of the business.
We believe that constant currency measures have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that
are eliminated constitute a significant element of our revenue and expenses and could materially
63/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
impact our performance. Therefore, we limit our use of constant currency measures to the analysis of
changes in volume as one element of the full change in a financial measure. We do not evaluate our
results and performance without considering operating profit (non-IFRS) at both nominal and constant
currencies on the one hand, and changes in operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS on the other. We caution the readers of our
financial reports to follow a similar approach by considering actual and constant currency non-IFRS
measures only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating
expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with
IFRS.
Despite these limitations, we believe that the presentation of our non-IFRS measures and the
corresponding IFRS measures, together with the relevant reconciliations, provide useful information to
management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial
condition and results of operations.

Financial Performance:
Review and Analysis
Economy and the Market
The global economy expanded at a moderate but steady pace in 2023, describes the European
Central Bank (ECB) in its most recent Economic Bulletin.1 It attributes this development to strong
private consumption and the support of resilient labor markets.
Concerning the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region, the euro area economy grew minimally over
the first half of 2023, reports the ECB. In the second half of the year, real GDP contracted slightly,
mostly due to a decline in inventories but also because of subdued confidence, low competitiveness,
renewed geopolitical tensions, and tighter financing conditions. However, services activity grew
modestly and contributed positively to growth in the second half of the year.
In the Americas region, U.S. economic growth showed more resilience than previously anticipated.
Despite significant tightening of monetary policy, the United States showed a solid domestic demand
and a strong labor market and, with significant government spending, reached a robust growth, states
the ECB.
As for the APJ (Asia Pacific Japan) region, Chinese economic activity stabilized in 2023, driven by
stronger consumer spending. The lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the beginning of the year and a
broader recovery in private consumption compensated for weakness in the Chinese residential sector.
In Japan, however, real GDP growth contracted in 2023, as high inflation weighed on activity and
consumption. However, growth returned to a slightly positive yet modest territory in the fourth quarter,
states the ECB.
The IT Market
“The digital business era has arrived. Spending on digital technologies is growing while traditional,
nondigital spending is stagnating or even slightly dropping. The demand for digital experiences from
customers, employees, partners, and suppliers has shifted to an expectation. Companies looking to
sustain and grow are seeking digital revenue streams while looking to digitize operations to reduce
costs and increase efficiency.”2 This is how International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market
research firm, summarizes the current IT market situation. Therefore, reports IDC, “in the post-pandemic
environment, digital-first strategies have moved from being a competitive advantage to being the basic
standard needed for survival. Legacy systems are increasingly proving to be bottlenecks, hindering
real-time data access and agile response mechanisms. In contrast, businesses that have embraced
digital transformation are reaping the benefits of adaptability and more insightful data-driven decision-
making.”3
In particular, IDC finds that “the technology within a digital business platform is essential for driving the
innovation and new revenue streams that companies are looking for in the digital business era” and
that “more digitally mature organizations with established digital business platforms are better able to
compete in an increasingly digital world.”2 That is because these “autonomous business processes
evolve the nature of information from intelligence to insights to immediate decisive actions. These
advances, when utilized, give organizations a competitive advantage in speed, scale, and agility and
will transform them into truly digital businesses.”3
“Today’s SaaS and cloud-enabled applications are packed with generative AI (GenAI), artificial
intelligence, machine learning (ML), microservices, APIs, and automated workflows,”3 explains IDC, and
elaborates: “The convergence of AI, automation, and analytics signals a transformative era in digital
business. As these technologies have matured, they offer organizations unprecedented capabilities to
drive innovation, optimize processes, and uncover actionable insights. This isn’t just about adopting
66/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
new tools; it’s a major shift toward ‘deep intelligence’ and automation, bringing agility and an insight-
driven approach to the center of digital enterprises.”4
A major topic, according to IDC, is sustainability: “ESG factors are swiftly emerging as critical
determinants of a company’s long-term value. In today’s business climate, ESG considerations are no
longer just a checklist. […] These are factoring in and becoming integral components to a company’s
strategic plans.”4 In IDC’s view, therefore, “sustainability is increasingly linked to digital business […].
Digital technology spending can be both directly and indirectly dedicated to sustainability initiatives,
either by specifically addressing corporate-sponsored endeavors or by establishing the platform
necessary to eventually carry out sustainability goals.”2 IDC assesses that “organizations are
increasingly turning to applications that can help them meticulously monitor and report their activities
as well as achieve real-world sustainability milestones.”3

Impact on SAP
Despite macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, SAP again showed high resilience and
all regions contributed positively to the results. The wind-down of business operations in Russia and
Belarus was nearly completed in the first quarter of 2023 and remaining contract obligations were
reduced to a non-material volume by the end of the year.
After two years of significant investments to accelerate SAP’s transition to the cloud (the so-called
phase one), the second phase of our cloud transformation started in January 2023 with the publication
of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. At that time, SAP showed the passing of the
tipping point towards positive profitability (non-IFRS), as planned and predicted in the strategy update
that was communicated in October 2020.
Continuous execution along the midterm ambition and forthcoming positive results over the remaining
quarters in 2023 underpinned SAP’s commitment to the corporate strategy. The focus on efficiencies
and disciplined spending resulted in a significant expansion of its cloud gross margins (non-IFRS)
throughout the year.
SAP has been an early adopter of AI technology. During the SAP Sapphire conference in May, the
Company showcased the use of AI in various products. At the beginning of the second half of 2023, the
Company announced strategic direct investments in three leading generative AI companies. The
investments underscore SAP’s open ecosystem approach to AI, which is aimed at leveraging the best
technology to embed AI across SAP’s portfolio. The Company anticipates significant possibilities for
market expansion through these technologies and new premium offerings.
Overall Financial Position
Executive Board’s Assessment
Given the macroeconomic environment outlined above, the course of business was again favorable for
Noteworthy is the strong momentum in our cloud business: cloud revenue was up 20%, reaching
€13.7 billion. SAP’s current cloud backlog (CCB) exceeded €13.7 billion, an increase of 25%. Total
revenue increased 6% to €31.2 billion, and IFRS operating profit decreased slightly to €5.8 billion. Non-
IFRS operating profit increased 9% to €8.7 billion. Free cash flow increased 16% to €5.1 billion.
Regarding SAP’s non-financial performance, we met our initial outlook ranges for all three of our most
important non-financial performance indicators: the Customer Net Promoter Score increased 6 points
to 9 (initial outlook: 8 to 12), the Employee Engagement Index remained unchanged at 80% (initial
outlook: 76% to 80%), and our net carbon emissions continued to decrease, dropping 85 kt to 0 kt
(initial outlook: 0 kt).
67/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
On this basis, we are confident we can deliver on our financial and non-financial outlook for 2024 and
on our updated 2025 ambition.
Performance Against Our Outlook for 2023 (Non-IFRS)
As in previous years, our 2023 operating profit-related goals and published outlook were based on our
non-IFRS financial measures at constant currencies. For this reason, in the following section we discuss
performance against our outlook in terms of non-IFRS numbers, unless otherwise stated, (at constant
currencies) derived from IFRS measures. The subsequent section about International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) operating results discusses numbers only in terms of IFRS, so the numbers
in that section are not expressly identified as IFRS numbers.
Outlook for 2023 (Non-IFRS)
The initial outlook for 2023, including Qualtrics (for more information, see the table Comparison of
Outlook and Results for 2023), expected full-year cloud revenue to range between €15.3 billion and
€15.7 billion, and cloud and software revenue to range between €28.2 billion and €28.7 billion, with
more predictable revenue anticipated to make up 83% of this result. Furthermore, we expected
operating profit (non-IFRS) to range between €8.8 billion and €9.1 billion and a free cash flow of
approximately €5.0 billion. We expected a full-year 2023 effective tax rate (IFRS) of 28.0% to 32.0%
(2022: 32.0%) and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 26.0% to 28.0% (2022: 29.6%), strongly depending
on the development of Sapphire Ventures’ investments. This initial outlook reflected SAP executing on
its cloud strategy, which is driving the accelerated cloud growth through both new business and cloud
adoption by existing customers, scaling SAP’s cloud momentum towards its midterm ambition.
In April 2023, we adjusted our outlook for continuing operations, reflecting the expected Qualtrics
divestiture. We thereafter expected cloud revenue to range between €14.0 billion and €14.4 billion,
cloud and software revenue to range between €26.9 billion and €27.4 billion, and operating profit (non-
IFRS) to range between €8.6 billion and €8.9 billion. Furthermore, we adjusted the anticipated share of
more predictable revenue to 82% and thereafter expected a free cash flow of approximately
€4.9 billion.
In July 2023, to reflect then-current market development, we updated and tightened our ranges
slightly. We lowered our expectations for cloud revenue to a range between €14.0 billion and
€14.2 billion, and for cloud and software revenue to a range between €27.0 billion and €27.4 billion, but
increased the range slightly for our expected operating profit (non-IFRS) to between €8.65 billion and
€8.95 billion.

– €17.0 billion to €17.3 billion in cloud revenue at constant currencies (2023: €13.66 billion), up 24%
to 27% at constant currencies
– €29.0 billion to €29.5 billion in cloud and software revenue at constant currencies
(2023: €26.92 billion), up 8% to 10% at constant currencies
– €7.6 billion to €7.9 billion non-IFRS operating profit at constant currencies (2023: €6.51 billion,
based on the updated non-IFRS operating profit definition and excluding gains and losses from less
material divestitures), up 17% to 22% at constant currencies.
– Free cash flow of approximately €3.5 billion (2023: €5.09 billion). This includes a preliminary
€2 billion estimate for payouts associated with the program, a €0.2 billion impact from a settlement
earlier this year of pre-existing regulatory compliance matters accrued in 2023, and a €0.2 billion
adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing program.
– An effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of around 32.0% (2023: 30.3%, based on the updated non-IFRS
definition)
Furthermore, SAP provides the following additional forward-looking information for selected metrics:
– CCB: we expect a year-end growth rate similar that of 2023, while at a larger scale.
– Cloud ERP Suite revenue: we expect to sustain the high growth rate in 2024.
currencies are likely to be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations as the year progresses. See the

Cloud revenue growth -2.0pp to 0.0pp
Cloud and software revenue growth -1.5pp to 0.5pp
Operating profit growth (non-IFRS) -2.0pp to 0.0pp

Furthermore, the differences between free cash flow as our non-IFRS financial measure and operating
cash flow as our IFRS financial measure include estimated cash flows in 2024 for leasing and capital
expenditures of €1.2 billion (2023: €1.1 billion).
We do not provide an outlook for the effective tax rate (IFRS) due to the uncertainty and potential
variability of gains and losses associated with equity investments, which are reconciling items between
non-IFRS and IFRS.
Proposed Dividend
In 2024, we intend to pay a dividend of €2.20 per share (subject to shareholder approval at the Annual
General Shareholders Meeting in May 2024). For more information, see the Financial Performance:

By 2025, SAP now expects:
– Non-IFRS cloud gross profit of approximately €16.2 billion, which now includes share-based
compensation expenses of approximately €0.1 billion1
– Non-IFRS operating profit of approximately €10.0 billion, which now includes share-based
compensation expenses of approximately €2 billion1
– Free cash flow of approximately €8.0 billion
SAP continues to expect:
– Cloud revenue of more than €21.5 billion
– Total revenue of more than €37.5 billion
– The share of more predictable revenue to be approximately 86%
Further, SAP strives for an acceleration of total revenue growth and an expansion of operating margin
beyond 2025.
1 Non-IFRS. Our Ambition for 2025 has been adjusted in accordance with our updated non-IFRS definition applicable from 2024. For more
information, see the Performance Management System section.
Note: For a reconciliation of non-IFRS results to IFRS equivalents, see the Performance Management System section.
Investment Goals
Our planned investment expenditures for 2024 and 2025, other than for business combinations,
consist primarily of the purchase of IT infrastructure and the construction activities described in the
Assets (IFRS) section. We expect investments in IT infrastructure to be approximately €400 million and
in construction activities to be approximately €350 million in 2024. In 2024, we expect total capital
expenditures of approximately €950 million. In 2025, capital expenditures are expected to decrease to
approximately €700 million.
Goals for Liquidity and Finance
As of December 31, 2023, our net liquidity was €3.5 billion. We believe that our liquid assets combined
with our undrawn credit facilities are sufficient to meet our operating financing needs in 2024 as well,
and, together with expected cash flows from operations, will support debt repayments and our
currently planned capital expenditure requirements over the near and medium term.
In 2024, we expect a free cash flow of approximately €3.5 billion (compared to €5.1 billion in 2023) and
of around €8.0 billion in 2025. The decline in free cash flow in 2024 will be driven predominantly by our
preliminary €2.0 billion estimated outflow for restructuring, a €200 million outflow for compliance
matters, and a €200 million adverse impact due to the discontinuation of the SAP-triggered financing
program.
In 2024, we intend to repay €850 million in Eurobonds and US$323 million in U.S. private placements.
The ratio of net debt as of December 31, 2023, divided by the total of operating profit (IFRS) plus
depreciation and amortization was –0.49x and therefore below our 2023 target of 0.5x.
Non-Financial Goals for 2024 and Ambition for 2025
In addition to our financial goals, we also focus on four non-financial targets: customer loyalty,
employee engagement, carbon impact, and women in executive roles.
For 2024, SAP expects employee engagement, measured by the Employee Engagement Index, to be
between 76% and 80% (2023: 80%). Through 2025, we aim to achieve a steady increase in our
Employee Engagement Index score.
SAP measures customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS). We expect
the score to be between 9 and 13 for Customer NPS in 2024. SAP expects to steadily increase the
Customer NPS through 2025.
145/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional

In 2024, we expect to steadily decrease carbon emissions across the relevant value chain. Further, SAP
has also committed to achieving net-zero along our value chain in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius future
in 2030.
expecting to steadily increase the percentage of women on Global Executive Team, Senior Executive
Team, and Executive Team level as we strive to achieve our target of 25% by the end of 2027.
Premises on Which Our Outlook and Prospects Are Based
In preparing our outlook and prospects, we have taken into account all events known to us at the time
we prepared this report that could influence SAP’s business going forward.
Outlook for SAP SE
The primary source of revenue for SAP SE is the license fees it charges subsidiaries for the right to
market and maintain SAP software solutions. Consequently, the performance of SAP SE in operating
terms is closely tied to the cloud and the software revenue of the SAP Group.
Due to the rise, at constant currencies, in non-IFRS cloud and software revenue anticipated for the
Given the Company-wide restructuring program we announced and the projected restructuring
expenses at SAP SE level, and assuming that there are no one-time effects relating to acquisitions or to
other non-recurring events, we expect SAP SE’s operating profit to decrease significantly.
We expect that this growth will also result in further revenue and profit growth for SAP SE to the same
degree. We expect that SAP SE will continue to receive investment income in the form of profit
transfers and dividends from its subsidiaries. The growth we expect for the SAP Group should have a
positive effect on this investment income.
The outlook for the SAP Group in respect to liquidity, finance, investment, and dividend is equally
applicable to SAP SE.
Among the assumptions underlying this outlook are those presented above concerning the economy
and our expectations for the performance of the SAP Group.
Opportunities
Our customers choose SAP as a trusted partner for their digital business transformation. We have
established a framework for opportunity management by evaluating and analyzing key areas such as
current markets, external scenarios, economic conditions, and technological trends. We have also
researched customer and product segmentation, growth drivers, and industry-specific factors for
success. These combined insights play a key role for the Executive Board in the development of our
market strategies. Our shareholder value relies heavily upon a fine balance of risk mitigation and value-
driven opportunities. Therefore, our governance model helps ensure that decisions are based on
return, investment required, and risk mitigation.
As far as opportunities are likely to occur, we have incorporated them into our business plans, our
outlook for 2024, and our medium-term prospects outlined in this report. Therefore, the following
section focuses on future trends or events that might result in an uplift of our outlook and medium-
term prospects should they develop more positively than anticipated in our forecasts.
SAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group and earns most of our revenue from subscription
fees, software license fees, and dividends paid by affiliates. Consequently, the opportunities described
below also apply – directly or indirectly – to SAP SE.
Opportunities from Economic Conditions
Economic conditions clearly influence our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. Should
the global economy recover faster than is reflected in our plans today, our revenue and profit may
surpass our current outlook and medium-term prospects. Our medium-term planning considers
146/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
changes in market conditions as a result of the ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic
environments. Although we continue to be mindful of the negative aspects of this global situation, we
take opportunities to further invest into our strategic growth areas.
For more information about future trends in the global economy and the IT market outlook, as well as
their potential influence on SAP, see the beginning of this Expected Developments and Opportunities
section.
Opportunities Through Innovation
Our continued growth through innovation is based on our ability to leverage research and
development (R&D) resources effectively. We are accelerating innovation cycles, especially in our
cloud solutions, and engaging even more closely with our customers to enable success. Specifically,
we focus on ease of adoption and consumption so customers can receive the benefits from our
software solutions, technologies, and platforms at reduced time to value.
Our aim is to bring our customers into a clean core in the cloud based on SAP S/4HANA Cloud and
enabled by our SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), which provides the required
extensibilities and thereby creates connectivity between our solutions. This clean core is intended to
enable multicloud adoption from our customers and partners.
To address new and critical environmental, economic, and social challenges, SAP embeds
SAP Business AI capabilities across our entire portfolio, a step we believe will increase customer
demand. In addition, SAP Business AI has the potential to simplify how people interact with SAP
solutions, and to increase the addressable user base.
Based on our innovation capabilities, we see opportunities to drive customer value by shaping the
future of business processes with next-generation, modular, industry-specific solutions that enhance
companies’ existing systems. Designed to drive unprecedented business agility, forge the future of
business collaboration, and enable companies to manage operations seamlessly within and beyond
organizational boundaries, said solutions are pioneering the future of data-driven decision-making,
empowering businesses to act boldly and with greater confidence. These enhancements could also
lead to increased demand across our cloud portfolio. For example, the accelerated adoption of
technology that helps companies take more sustainable decisions and that we natively build in our
SAP S/4HANA Cloud could result in additional upsell opportunities for customers migrating to cloud
ERP.
We also see high growth potential in four adjacent innovation areas: sustainability management,
working capital management (accelerated through the Taulia portfolio), business networks,
business transformation solutions (accelerated through the SAP Signavio portfolio and LeanIX
solutions) that help us deliver on our vision and commitments to help customers reach agility at scale,
achieve more across the value chain, and become sustainable at their core.
In addition, we continue to expand startup engagement in strategic opportunity areas, focusing on
startups as customers and partners.
For more information about future opportunities in research and development for SAP, see the
Strategy and Business Model section.
Opportunities from Our Strategy for Profitable Growth
SAP strives to generate profitable growth across our portfolio of products, solutions, and services to
keep and improve our market position. Our aim is to continue to expand our addressable market by
enhancing our portfolio and our new technologies and innovations. As an industry, we are benefiting
from a secular trend toward digitalization, cloud, and the rise of AI, and are strengthening the market’s
readiness to consume software in the cloud, including core business process platforms.
To positively affect the profitability of our cloud business, we set clear priorities to optimize efficiency
in our cloud operations. Our operational excellence priorities include a focus on adoption and
consumption of our product portfolio, leading to more efficient sales and marketing invest; a focused
product portfolio leading to more effective R&D investment; more centralized business operations
147/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
leading to end-to-end-optimization; and an accelerated workforce transformation leading to a future-
ready workforce.
SAP seeks to establish new business models and leverage its expanding ecosystem of partners to
achieve scale and maximize opportunities. Building on our success with RISE with SAP, we are moving
toward expansion and have launched Grow with SAP, a dedicated offering for midmarket companies
that is helping us win net-new customers.
New commercial models such as RISE Premium Plus increase the focus on packaged suite sales and
flexible consumption, making sure we capture the significant cross-sell potential of our suite while
decreasing cost of sales for the acquisition of net-new customers and increasing customer lifetime
value with existing customers.
Our strong focus on technical integration between our line-of-business (LoB) solutions and
SAP S/4HANA, to provide a seamless and delightful experience for our customers, may uplift the
cross-sell potential of our suite portfolio and create operational synergies.
to focus on key strategic growth areas, in particular business AI. Through this program, SAP intends to
transform its operational setup to capture organizational synergies and AI-driven efficiencies, and to
prepare the Company for highly scalable future revenue growth.
Opportunities from Our Ecosystem
SAP’s ecosystem is defined by the interdependent relationships of our customers, our employees, our
suppliers, our partners, and our complementary technology partners. Our ecosystem, which includes
more than 25,000 partners with different areas of expertise, carries the SAP brand into global markets
and expands our portfolio with their expertise, services, and solutions. Our ecosystem includes
partners in four different tracks: partners in the “Build” track develop solutions on top of, or integrate
with, SAP technology and platforms; extending the scope and functionality of SAP solutions to address
customer requirements; partners in the “Sell” track advise, resell, implement, and support customers of
all types and sizes; partners in the “Service” track (systems integrators) provide strategic business
consulting, system design, solution integration, and project implementation of SAP solutions; partners
in the “Run” track are outsourcing or hosting companies that offer SAP solutions to customers through
a private or public cloud.
SAP and our partner ecosystem offer solutions to help customers grow their businesses and
accelerate their move to the cloud. SAP partners build innovative extensions for SAP applications
based on SAP BTP, and in doing so, enhance the customer value offered by SAP. We continue to focus
on developing new talent and capacity in the partner ecosystem to support the increased demand for
customer cloud transformations. By providing innovations that extend SAP applications, partners can
influence the adoption of SAP technologies to support customers’ unique business needs. Thus,
customers maximize their SAP investment through partner offerings such as industry-specific solutions,
LoB solutions, added functionality, and sustainability offerings.
Partners constantly respond to market needs while raising awareness around strategic offerings, such
as RISE with SAP, SAP BTP, and our industry cloud solutions, which drive the transformation in the
cloud for our customers. Partners offer customers a vast array of SAP technologies and services
specific to their LoB or industry, making it easy for customers to purchase the right combination of
products, solutions, and services (such as consulting, implementation, and development) to meet their
business needs.
Partners contribute to SAP’s growth by expanding market reach in sales and services, specifically by
retaining and increasing sales to existing customers, attracting new customers, accessing new markets,
and addressing our joint customers’ requirements with their expertise and solution innovations.
Together with all the aforementioned measures, this may positively impact our revenue, profit, cash
flows, customer satisfaction and retention, and enable SAP to exceed our stated medium-term
prospects.

Opportunities from Our Employees
Our employees drive innovation, provide value to our customers, and consistently enable our growth
and profitability. We continuously invest in our people with the aim of retaining their high level of
engagement, further strengthening their skills, fostering an agile and innovative organization, and
ensuring a healthy, diverse, and inclusive workforce. By doing so, we anticipate improvements in our
employee productivity and innovation capabilities.
Our outlook and medium-term prospects are based on certain assumptions regarding employee
retention and our Business Health Culture Index. Should these develop at a rate that is better than
expected, employee productivity and engagement may increase. A stronger-than-expected increase in
the Employee Engagement Index can therefore be an opportunity that could positively impact our
revenue, profit, and cash flows, enabling SAP to exceed our stated medium-term prospects.
For more information about future opportunities relating to our employees, see the Employees section.
Executive Board’s Overall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks
In our view, considering their impact level and likelihood of occurrence, the risks described in our
aggregated risk report do not individually or cumulatively threaten our ability to continue as a going
concern. While individual risks, individual opportunities, and assessments may have changed during
2023, our overall risk profile and overall opportunities profile did not change materially compared to
the prior year. Management remains confident that the Group’s earnings strength forms a solid basis
for our future business development and provides the necessary resources to pursue the
opportunities available to the Group. Based on our structured processes for early risk identification, we
are confident that, in 2024, we can continue to counter the challenges arising from the risks in our
current risk profile.

Section D – Invested Capital
This section highlights our non-current assets including investments that form the basis of our
operating activities. Additions to invested capital include separate asset acquisitions or business
combinations. Further, we disclose information about purchase obligations and capital contributions.
(D.1) Business Combinations and Divestitures
Measuring Non-Controlling Interests and Allocation of Consideration
Transferred
We decide for each business combination whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the
acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
We classify costs related to executing business combinations as general and administration expense.
In our accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in determining whether an
intangible asset is identifiable and whether it should be recorded separately from goodwill.
Additionally, estimating the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed involves considerable judgment. The necessary measurements are based on information
available on the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been
deemed reasonable by management. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially
affect our financial position and profit for several reasons, including the following:
– Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and amortization affect the amounts of
depreciation and amortization to be recorded in operating profit in the periods following the
acquisition.
– Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of assets may result in additional
expense from impairment charges.
– Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities and provisions may result in additional
expense (if increasing the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing the estimated fair
value).
We acquire businesses in specific areas of strategic interest to us, particularly to broaden our product
and service portfolio.
2023 Acquisitions
LeanIX Acquisition
On September 7, 2023, SAP announced its intent to acquire 100% of the shares of LeanIX GmbH
(“LeanIX”), a leader in enterprise architecture management (EAM) software.
The acquisition closed on November 7, 2023, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions
and regulatory approvals; the operating results and the assets and liabilities are reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements starting on that date.
The acquisition is expected to further expand SAP’s business transformation portfolio, giving
customers access to the full suite of tools required for continuous business transformation and
facilitating AI-enabled process optimization.
Consideration transferred amounted to €1,231 million paid in cash.
192/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
The following table summarizes the values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
connection with the acquisition of LeanIX, as at the acquisition date:
LeanIX Acquisition: Recognized Assets and Liabilities
€ millions
Intangible assets 476
Other identifiable assets 102
Total identifiable assets 578
Other identifiable liabilities 214
Total identifiable liabilities 214
Total identifiable net assets 364
Goodwill 867
Total consideration transferred 1,231
As we are still obtaining the information necessary to identify and measure certain assets and
liabilities, mainly tax-related items, the initial accounting for the LeanIX business combination is still
incomplete.
In general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-
how and skills of the acquired businesses’ workforces.
LeanIX goodwill was attributed to expected synergies from the acquisition, particularly in the following
areas:
– Cross-selling to existing SAP customers across all regions, using SAP’s sales organization
– Creating new offerings by combining LeanIX products and SAP products
– LeanIX complements the transformation capabilities of SAP Signavio solutions and will give SAP
customers unique clarity on the IT landscapes they need to reap the full benefit of business
transformation
The allocation of the goodwill resulting from the LeanIX acquisition to our operating segments
depends on how our operating segments actually benefit from the synergies of the LeanIX business
combination. For more information, see Note (D.2).
Impact of the Business Combination on Our Financial Statements

# Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow

€ millions 2023 2022 ∆ in %
Net cash flows from operating activities 6,210 5,675 9
Net cash flows from investing activities –4,603 699 <–100
Net cash flows from financing activities –7,758 –6,074 28
In 2023, cash inflows from operating activities increased €535 million to €6,210 million
(2022: €5,675 million). This is particularly due to higher profitability, improvements in working capital,
lower share-based payments (€1.1 billion in 2023 compared to €1.2 billion in 2022), and higher net
interest received (€0.1 billion in 2023 compared to €0.1 billion net interest paid in 2022), which were
compensated by higher income tax payments (€2.2 billion in 2023 compared to €1.6 billion in 2022)
and higher restructuring payouts (€0.2 billion in 2023 compared to €0.1 billion in 2022). In addition, the
decreased volume of trade receivables sold in 2023 amounting to €0.6 billion (€0.9 billion in 2022)
affected operating cash flow. Cash collected from customer contracts increased compared to 2022.
Cash outflows from investing activities were €4,603 million in 2023, compared to €699 million cash
inflows in 2022. We increased short-term time deposits and debt instruments by €2.5 billion. We paid,
net of cash received, a total of €1.2 billion mainly for the LeanIX acquisition in 2023, compared to
€0.7 billion mainly for the Taulia and Askdata acquisitions in 2022. We received, net of taxes paid,
approximately €5.5 billion for the divestiture of Qualtrics in 2023. Capital expenditure on intangible
assets and property, plant, and equipment decreased to €0.8 billion (€0.9 billion in 2022). For more
information about current and planned capital expenditures, see the Assets section and the
Investment Goals section.
In 2023, free cash flow (for the definition, see the Performance Management System section) increased
to €5,093 million (2022: €4,388 million). The free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow as
a percentage of profit after tax, decreased to 141% (2022: 143%).
Net cash outflows from financing activities were €7,758 million in 2023, compared to €6,074 million in
2022. The buyback of treasury shares with a volume of €0.95 billion in 2023 is included herein. Apart
from the buyback of treasury shares, cash outflows in 2023 resulted from the repayment of €1.6 billion
in Eurobonds, €1.45 billion in loans, and €0.93 billion in commercial paper when they matured. In 2022,
we bought back treasury shares with a volume of €1.5 billion. Further cash outflows in 2022 resulted
from the repayment of €0.9 billion in Eurobonds and US$0.445 billion in U.S. private placements when
they matured.
The dividend payment made in 2023 was €2,395 million compared to €2,865 million paid the
preceding year.

(D.5) Leases
Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates
Under IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, SAP recognizes a right-
of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and
interest expense is recognized on the lease liabilities. The vast majority of our leases consist of facility
and data center leases. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease
term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.

Product revenue increased 4% to €14,055 million (2022: €13,550 million). As in previous years, product
revenue was primarily generated from license fees paid by subsidiaries of SAP SE.
Service revenue increased 11% to €1,065 million in 2023 (2022: €958 million), while other revenue
increased 19% to €3,898 million (2022: €3,278 million).
income increased €3,463 million to €4,996 million (2022: €1,534 million). The year-over-year increase is
primarily due to €3,749 million in gains from the disposal of affiliated companies as a result of the intra-
Group share buyback by SAP America Inc.
received increased €579 million to €10,177 million (2022: €9,599 million), mainly due to increased
services received in the context of intra-Group cost allocations. The costs for licenses and
commissions increased €93 million to €2,006 million (2022: €1,914 million).
SAP SE personnel expenses, mainly the labor cost of software developers, service and support
employees, and administration staff employed by SAP SE, increased 17% to €3,386 million
(2022: €2,905 million), primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expenses and an
increased headcount in the reporting year.
87/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Other operating expenses decreased €104 million to €3,329 million (2022: €3,433 million). This
decrease is mainly attributable to a €287 million decrease in currency exchange losses and a
€36 million decrease in impairment of receivables. The decrease was partly offset by a €114 million
increase in services purchased and by a €179 million increase in other expense, mainly attributable to
€155 million in regulatory compliance expenses.
Finance income was €897 million (2022: €1,685 million), representing a year-over-year decrease of
€788 million. This decrease is primarily due to a €694 million decrease in net interest income, a
€79 million decrease in results from profit and loss transfer agreements, and a €84 million increase in
write-downs on financial assets. The decrease was partly offset by a €61 million increase in income
from investments.
taxes increased €7 million to €504 million (2022: €497 million). After deducting taxes, the resulting net
income was €4,766 million (2022: €1,912 million), representing a increase of €2,854 million year over
year.

Intangible assets decreased €450 million year over year to €1,111 million (2022: €1,561 million), mainly
due to scheduled depreciations on intangibles.
Financial assets decreased €3,589 million year over year to €34,323 million (2022: €37,912 million). This
was mainly due to the disposal of shares in affiliated companies totaling €5,254 million. Of this,
€4,244 million was attributable to the share buyback of SAP America Inc., and €929 million was
attributable to the SAP Portals Europe GmbH shares canceled as a result of the merger. Additions to
the shares in affiliated companies amounting to €1,782 million had an opposite effect. Of this amount,
88/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional

€1,238 million was attributable to the acquisition of LeanIX GmbH, Bonn, Germany, and €493 million
was attributable to the shares in SAP Nederland B.V., 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, taken over as part
of the merger of SAP Portals Europe GmbH.
The increase of €243 million in accounts receivable and other assets was primarily the result of a
€168 million increase in receivables from affiliated companies and a €77 million increase in other
assets.
Marketable securities and liquid assets increased €2,355 million to €3,788 million
(2022: €1,423 million).
of €2,395 million associated with the payment of the dividend and €960 million for the repurchase of
stock in treasury, there was a €4,766 million increase due to net income for 2022 and €995 million from
the issuance of treasury stock to serve the share-based payments of employees. The equity ratio (that
is, the ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets) is 33% (2022: 28%).
Provisions increased €436 million to €2,846 million (2022: €2,410 million). Other provisions increased
€437 million to €2,091 million (2022: €1,654 million), primarily as a result of an increase in other
obligations toward employees and provisions for stock-based compensation. Provisions for tax
remained at €741 million (2022: €741 million).
Liabilities decreased €4,084 million to €28,951 million (2022: €33,036 million). This decrease mainly
resulted from a decrease in liabilities to financial institutions of €2,380 million due to scheduled
repayments of bank loans (€1,450 million) and commercial papers (€930 million), the scheduled
repayment of bonds in the total amount of €1,600 million, and a decrease of €218 million in trade
payables. In contrast, other payables increased €143 million.
The statements made for the SAP Group in respect to Capital Structure, Capital Expenditures and
Liquidity are mainly equally applicable to SAP SE. For more information, see the Finances (IFRS)

# Risk Factors

We are exposed to liquidity risk from our obligations towards suppliers, employees, and financial
institutions.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity is managed by our global treasury department with the primary aim of maintaining
liquidity at a level that is adequate to meet our financial obligations.
Generally, our primary source of liquidity is funds generated from our business operations. Our global
treasury department manages liquidity centrally for all subsidiaries. Where possible, we pool their cash
surplus so that we can use liquidity centrally for our business operations, for subsidiaries’ funding
requirements, or to invest any net surplus in the market. With this strategy, we seek to optimize yields,
while ensuring liquidity, by investing only with counterparties and issuers of high credit quality, as
explained before. Hence, high levels of liquid assets and marketable securities provide a strategic
reserve, helping keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent.
228/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Apart from effective working capital and cash management, we have reduced the liquidity risk inherent
in managing our day-to-day operations and meeting our financing responsibilities by arranging an
adequate volume of available credit facilities with various financial institutions on which we can draw if
necessary.
In order to retain high financial flexibility, in 2023, SAP SE entered into a sustainability-linked revolving
credit facility with a volume of €3.0 billion with an initial term until 2028 plus two one-year extension
options, replacing its previous credit facility of €2.5 billion from 2017. The use of the facility is not
restricted by any financial covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or the
agreed benchmark rate for the respective currency plus a base margin which might be adjusted
depending on the fulfillment of agreed sustainability performance targets. We are also required to pay
a commitment fee of 7bps per annum on the unused available credit. We have not drawn on the
facility.
In September 2019, we initiated a commercial paper (Commercial Paper, or CP) program. As at
December 31, 2023, we had €0 million of CP outstanding with maturities generally less than six months
(2022: €930 million).
Additionally, as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group had available lines of credit totaling
€555 million and €555 million, respectively. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding under these
lines of credit in all years presented.
Liquidity Risk Exposure
The table below is an analysis of the remaining contractual maturities of all our financial liabilities and
guarantees held as at December 31, 2023.
Financial liabilities for which repayment can be requested by the contract partner at any time are
assigned to the earliest possible period. Variable interest payments were calculated using the latest
relevant interest rate fixed as at December 31, 2023. As we generally settle our derivative contracts
gross, we show the pay and receive legs separately for all our currency and interest rate derivatives,
whether or not the fair value of the derivative is negative. The cash outflows for the currency derivatives
are translated using the applicable spot rate.
We continue to provide rental guarantees for certain offices used by Qualtrics. The amounts shown for
the financial guarantees are the gross amounts we guarantee, however, we are entitled to
indemnification payments by Qualtrics which will reduce the guarantee amounts disclosed.

# Overview of Risk Factors

(Aggregated Statement for 2023)
Probability Impact Risk Level

# Economic, Political, Social, and Regulatory Risks

Global Economic and Political Environment: Uncertainty in the global economy and/or financial
markets, and social and political instability caused by state-based conflicts, terrorist attacks,
civil unrest, war, or international hostilities could lead to disruptions in our business.
As a global company, we are influenced by multiple external factors that are difficult to predict, may
develop quickly, and are beyond our influence and control. These include, among others: crises
affecting credit or liquidity markets; regional or global recessions; sharp fluctuations in commodity
prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates; inflation or deflation; sovereign debt and bank debt
rating downgrades; restructurings or defaults; adverse geopolitical events (such as Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict); rising military tensions around the world (such as the China-
Taiwan tensions) and in particular within Europe’s borders; global policy including in the United States,
the European Union (EU), Russia, and China; and global pandemic diseases such as COVID-19.
Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial
position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we increase our share of more predictable revenue streams from cloud
subscriptions and software support revenue streams, providing increased stability against financial
volatility; and, supported by our global government affairs unit, we continuously monitor and evaluate
global and political developments, to share insights and provide guidance to allow for proactive
preparation and timely mitigation.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
International Laws and Regulations: Laws, regulatory requirements and standards in Germany,
the United States, and elsewhere continue to be very stringent. Our international business
activities and processes expose us to numerous and often conflicting laws and regulations,
policies, standards, or other requirements, and sometimes even conflicting regulatory
requirements.
The SAP Group has a global presence and operates in most countries of the world. As a European
company domiciled in Germany with securities listed in Germany and the United States, we are
subject to European, German, U.S., and other governance-related regulatory requirements of the
countries we operate in.
Our business is subject to numerous risks inherent to international business operations and associated
consequences, such as changes in tax laws, changes in external reporting standards, and the
interpretation of the complex tax rules in certain countries, including but not limited to conflict and
overlap among tax regimes as well as the introduction of new tax concepts that harm digitalized
business models; discriminatory, protectionist, or conflicting fiscal policies and tax laws; import and
export regulations and trade sanctions; counter or even conflicting sanctions; embargoes, including but
not limited to country-specific software certification requirements; and newly emerging cybersecurity
and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance and disclosure laws.
As we expand into new countries and markets or extend our business activities in these markets,
including emerging and high-risk markets, these risks could intensify. The application of the respective
local laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear, subject to change over time, and
often conflicting among jurisdictions. Additionally, these laws and government approaches to
enforcement continue to change and evolve, just as our products and services continually evolve.
Compliance with these varying laws and regulations, including antitrust regulations, could involve
significant costs or require changes in our products or business practices. Non-compliance could
result in the imposition of penalties or cessation of orders due to alleged non-compliant activity.
Governmental authorities could use considerable discretion in applying these statutes and any
imposition of sanctions against us could be material.
131/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations globally or in one or more
countries or regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: monitor new and increased regulatory requirements; continuously invest in,
improve, and standardize our global processes, procedures, and solutions; proactively assess newly
emerging regulatory initiatives; consult external economic and tax advisors, law firms, and authorities in
the concerned countries; and take legal action when necessary.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be business-critical. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be
remote, and classify this risk factor as medium.
Legal and IP: Claims and lawsuits against us, such as for IP infringements, or our inability to
obtain or maintain adequate licenses for third-party technology, or if we are unable to protect or
enforce our own intellectual property, may result in adverse outcomes.
We have in the past, and believe that we will continue to be subject to, claims and lawsuits, including
intellectual property infringement claims, as our solution portfolio grows; as we acquire companies
with increased use of third-party code including open source code; as we expand into new industries
with our offerings, resulting in greater overlap in the functional scope of offerings; and as non-practicing
entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products assert intellectual property
infringement claims.
Moreover, protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to our success. The outcome of
litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:
dependency in the aggregate on third-party technology, including cloud and Web services, that we
embed in our products or that we resell to our customers; integration of open source software
components from third parties into our software and the implications derived from it; inability to
prevent third parties from obtaining, using, or selling without authorization what we regard as our
proprietary technology and information; and the possibility that third parties might reverse-engineer or
otherwise obtain and use technology and information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, the
laws and courts of certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our legal or intellectual
property rights. Finally, SAP may not be able to collect or otherwise enforce all judgments awarded to
it in legal proceedings. The outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.
Management’s view of the litigation might also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and
other claims or lawsuits could differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods,
which are the basis for our accounting for these litigations and claims under IFRS.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: have various internal programs, such as internal policies, processes, and
monitoring in place to assess and manage the risks associated with open source and third-party
intellectual property; endeavor to protect ourselves in the respective third-party software agreements
by obtaining certain rights in case such agreements are terminated; and are a party to certain patent
cross-license agreements with third parties.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Data Protection and Privacy: Non-compliance with increasingly complex and stringent,
sometimes even conflicting, applicable data protection and privacy laws, or failure to meet the
contractual requirements of SAP’s customers with respect to our products and services, could
lead to civil liabilities and fines, as well as loss of customers.
As a global software and service provider, SAP is required to comply with local laws wherever it does
business. One of the relevant European data protection laws is the General Data Protection Regulation.
International data transfers to third countries that do not provide for an adequate level of data
132/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
protection require additional safeguards, including transfer risk assessments, to justify a transfer from
the EU to a third country under the new EU standard contractual clauses.
Furthermore, evolving data protection and privacy laws, regulations, and other standards around the
world (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law
including data localization requirements, the EU Digital Services Act, and the EU’s proposed e-Privacy
Regulation) are increasingly aimed at protecting individuals’ personal information when it comes to
marketing and tracking their online activities. This may impose additional burdens for SAP due to
increasing compliance standards that could restrict the use and adoption of SAP’s products and
services (in particular cloud services) and make it more challenging and complex to meet customer
expectations. These changing criteria also impact the compliant use of new technology, such as
machine learning and Artificial Intelligence for product development and deployment of intelligent
applications.
Non-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by SAP or any of the subprocessors
engaged by SAP within the processing of personal data could lead to risks. These include, among
others: mandatory disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, customers, and data protection
supervisory authorities; investigations and administrative measures by data protection supervisory
authorities, such as the instruction to alter or stop non-compliant data processing activities, including
the instruction to stop using non-compliant subprocessors; or the possibility of damage claims by
customers and individuals, contract terminations, and potential fines.
In addition, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and security industry
experts continue to warn of risks related to a globally growing number of cybersecurity attacks aimed
at obtaining or violating company data including personal data.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial
performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: have implemented internal processes and measures to enable SAP to
comply successfully and sufficiently with applicable data protection requirements; anchor data
protection requirements in the mandatory product standards of SAP’s product development lifecycle;
continuously review SAP’s existing standards and policies to address changes to applicable laws and
regulations; continuously enhance our data center operations worldwide; actively monitor legal
developments; engage with political stakeholders and government authorities; and provide clear
governance and guidance on data handling, processing standards, and external communication as
part of our data management framework, specifically incorporating aspects of new technologies such
as those represented in embedded intelligence applications.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Corporate Governance and Compliance Risks
Ethical Behavior: Our global business exposes us to risks related to unethical behavior and non-
compliance with policies by employees, other individuals, partners, third parties, or entities
associated with SAP.
SAP’s leadership position in the global market is founded on the long-term and sustainable trust of our
stakeholders worldwide. Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open
communication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, and adherence to recognized
standards of business integrity. This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is
formalized in SAP’s CoEBC and supporting guidelines.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: non-
compliance with our policies and violation of compliance related rules, regulations, and legal
requirements including, but not limited to, antitrust, anticorruption, and antibribery legislation in
Germany, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting
corrupt conduct; unethical and fraudulent behavior leading to criminal charges, fines, and claims by
affected parties; collusion with external third parties; fraud and corruption; public sector transactions in
133/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
territories exposed to a high risk of corruption; or increased exposure and impact on business activities
in highly regulated industries.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows. In recent years, the investigation team within SAP’s Office of
Ethics & Compliance (OEC), together with the assistance of an external law firm, investigated
whistleblower complaints alleging that the business conduct of some former SAP employees within
subsidiary SAP companies did not comply with SAP’s policies and procedures or applicable laws.
These investigations culminated in January 2024 in a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), as well as with
local authorities in South Africa. SAP fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities, and took
immediate steps to discipline the employees involved, including terminating all those implicated in
potential law violations. Since these allegations were made, SAP has also significantly strengthened its
compliance program and related internal controls in accordance with DOJ and regulatory expectations
and requirements.
SAP has encountered situations in the past that required clear messaging and strong action on non-
compliance in the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and
reputation. SAP is continuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: continuously evolve our comprehensive compliance program based on the
three pillars of prevention, detection, and response; improve associated business processes, to
prevent further and future violations; review partner business models, to mitigate risks of corruption
while meeting agility requirements; conduct internal audits of our compliance programs related to
bribery, corruption, and substantial fraud; annually reconfirm commitment to the CoEBC by SAP’s
workforce (except where disallowed by local legal regulations); implement compliance policies and
processes aimed at managing third parties and preventing misuse of third-party payments for illegal
purposes, including the performance of compliance due diligence activities prior to the engagement of
third parties; and launched a Partner Integrity Initiative aimed at examining the compliance programs of
partners in SAP’s ecosystem and reviewing the SAP-related deals closed by them. We also introduced
a platform called "Speak Out at SAP" for anyone within and outside of SAP to raise confidentially and, if
desired, anonymously their concerns on ethics and compliance related to our CoEBC and any law or
regulation.
Despite our comprehensive and continuously evolving compliance programs and internal controls,
intentional efforts of individuals to circumvent controls or engage in corruption, especially by way of
collusion with other involved parties, cannot always be prevented.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Operational Business Risks
Sales and Services: Sales and implementation of SAP software and services, including cloud, are
subject to several significant risks sometimes beyond our direct control.
A core element of our business is the successful implementation of software and service solutions.
The implementation of SAP software and cloud-based service deliveries is led by SAP, by partners, by
customers, or by a combination thereof.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:
implementation risks caused by insufficient or incorrect information provided by customers, insufficient
customer expectation management, including scope, integration capabilities and aspects, and a lack of
purposeful selection, implementation, or utilization of SAP solutions; a lack of customer commitments
and respective engagements; challenges to achieve a seamlessly integrated, sufficiently automated
and aligned service delivery; unrenderable services committed during the sales stage; inadequate
contracting and consumption models based on subscription models for services, support, and
application management; deviations from standard terms and conditions; or statements concerning

solution developments that might be misperceived by customers as commitments on future software
functionalities.
Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or financial
position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: integrate risk management processes into SAP’s project management
methods that are intended to safeguard implementations through coordinated risk and quality
management programs; conduct ethical scope reviews and monitoring that are adapted as required as
part of a clearly defined change request process together with respective project governance, steering,
monitoring and controlling activities; and put in place a policy that clearly outlines communication
rules on future functionalities as well as legal requirements for commitments to customers.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Partner Ecosystem: If we are unable to scale, maintain, and enhance an effective partner
ecosystem, revenue might not increase as expected.
An open and vibrant partner ecosystem is a fundamental pillar of our success and growth strategy. We
have entered into partnership agreements that drive co-innovation on our platforms, profitably expand
our routes to market to optimize market coverage, optimize cloud delivery, and provide high-quality
services capacity in all market segments. Partners play a key role in driving market adoption of our
entire solutions portfolio, by co-innovating on our platforms, embedding our technology, and reselling
or implementing our software.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: failure to
establish and enable a network of qualified and fully committed partners; failure of partners to
develop sufficient innovative solutions and content on our platforms or to provide high-quality
products or services to meet customer expectations; failure of partners to embed our solutions
sufficiently enough to profitably drive product adoption; failure of partners to adhere to applicable
legal and compliance regulations; failure of partners to transform their business model in accordance
with the transformation of SAP’s business model in a timely manner; and failure of partners to comply
with contract terms in embargoed or high-risk countries.
If any of these risks materialize, this might have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and
services as well as the partner’s loyalty and ability to deliver. As a result, we might not be able to scale
our business to compete successfully with other vendors, which could have an adverse effect on our
reputation, business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: develop and enhance a wide range of partner programs to retain existing and
attract new partners; offer training opportunities for our partners; provide safeguarding services to
customers and partners; introduced a partner delivery quality framework; and implemented a
certification process for third-party solutions to ensure consistent high-quality and seamless
integration.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Cloud Operations: We may not be able to properly protect and safeguard our critical
information and assets, business operations, cloud offerings and portfolio presentation, and
related infrastructure against cyberattacks, insufficient infrastructure, disruption, or deficient
performance.
SAP is highly dependent on the availability, integrity, and reliability of our infrastructure, including
infrastructure provided by third-party business partners, and the software used in our cloud portfolio is
inherently complex. Customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to
protect the availability of our services and the data that they store on our infrastructure. Threat actors

are focused on attacking third-party product and service providers, such as SAP, as a means of
compromising our and our downstream customers’ systems and data.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: the cloud
portfolio or strategic direction of cloud operations may not fully meet customer demands; customers’
cloud service demands may not match our data center capacity or control investments; capacity
shortages could affect SAP’s ability to deliver and operate cloud services as expected by or
committed to our customers; scalability demands on infrastructure and operation could lead to cost
increases and margin impacts; hyperscaler or infrastructure instabilities and the lack of availability or
comprehensive contractual agreements could lead to challenges in meeting service level agreement
(SLA) commitments; we might lack sufficient “future skills” for delivering and operating hybrid
environments; we might lack the automation, standardization, and tools to manage and optimize
operations and infrastructure; local legal requirements or changes to data sovereignty may lead to
customers relocating their landscapes to a different data center; the loss of the right to use hardware
purchased or leased from third parties could affect our ability to provide our cloud applications;
disruptions to SAP’s cloud applications portfolio (such as system outages or downtimes, SAP network
failure due to human or other errors, security breaches, or variability in user traffic for cloud
applications) could affect customer SLAs; hardware failures or system errors might result in data loss
or corruption; exploitation by threat actors of known and previously unknown (“zero day”) security
vulnerabilities in our or our customers’ systems and software, including as a result of our or our
customers’ failure to patch such vulnerabilities in a timely or effective manner; partner co-location of
data centers might not adhere to our quality standards; or we might not comply with applicable
certification requirements, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: consolidated and harmonized our data centers and our data protection
measures, which included implementing security information and event management solutions as well
as enforcing network access control; invest significantly in infrastructure and processes to ensure
consistently secure operations of our cloud solutions while continuously improving resistance,
resilience, reusability, and scalability towards a standardized and harmonized portfolio; continuously
enhance our infrastructure landscape capabilities and deployment options, including harmonized,
efficient, and highly repetitive migration services; adhere to stringent SLAs with hyperscalers to ensure
a high-quality customer experience; increase transparency through our continuously enhanced and
expanded SAP Trust Center, in an effort to provide an appropriate level of information, for example,
regarding planned patching activities and associated downtimes; monitor and invest in the continuous
enhancement of our disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities; continuously aim for a
homogeneous landscape that supports the complex infrastructure, application, and security
requirements so that we can deliver the required service level for cloud services in a cost-effective
manner; set up physical access control systems at facilities, multilevel access controls, closed-circuit
television surveillance, security personnel in all critical areas, and recurring social engineering tests for
SAP premises and data centers; control the access to information and information systems using
authorization concepts that include managers and employees being regularly sensitized to the issues
and given mandatory security and compliance trainings; adapt our cloud service delivery to local or
specific market requirements (such as local or regional data centers) and comply with all local legal
regulations regarding data protection and privacy as well as data security; establish contracts and
SLAs with our public cloud partners to ensure that data security and privacy measures meet local
regulatory and compliance standards and SAP’s own standards for data security and privacy; maintain
strict internal policies and controls concerning utilization of our partner’s cloud infrastructure, including
people, process, and technology standards required to enhance compliance and cyber resilience;
closely monitor data center utilization, capacity, and pipeline for subsequent investment planning;
regularly conduct risks reviews, disclosure requests, and audits to ensure public cloud providers meet
SAP’s data privacy and security standards; ensure PCI-validated compliance through successful
PCI DSS audits; invest in training and certifications concerning hyperscaler and related next-generation
technologies; and implement best-of-breed tools for IT operations management and automation.

We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely, and
classify this risk factor as medium.
Cybersecurity and Security: Cybersecurity attacks or breaches, and security vulnerabilities in
our infrastructure or services or those of our third-party partners could materially impact our
business operations, products, and service delivery.
SAP delivers a full portfolio of solutions, hosts or manages elements of our customers’ businesses in
the cloud, processes large amounts of data, and provides mobile solutions to users. While SAP
executes each of these areas either directly or through partners and other third parties, our industry
continues to experience a complex and threatening cybersecurity landscape. The severity of these
cybersecurity threats is amplified due to the increasingly sophisticated and malicious global
landscape in which we operate. This includes third-party data, products, and services that we
incorporate into SAP products and services, and the increasingly advanced obfuscation, control-
circumvention, and related techniques and tools – such as artificial intelligence – employed by threat
actors targeting IT products, businesses, and the supply chain. When we become aware of
unauthorized access to our systems or those of our third-party partners, we have action plans in place
intended to identify and remediate the source and impact of such events. Like many companies, we
and certain of our third-party partners have experienced and expect to continue to experience
cyberattacks and other security incidents that affect our business. While we experience cybersecurity
incidents of various kinds in the ordinary course of our business, we are not aware of any such
incidents that have had a material impact on our business.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in many areas including, but not limited to, an
increasing number of global threat actor attacks using ransomware as their preferred method of attack
as well as exploiting known and unknown bugs, errors and vulnerabilities in our software and systems
or those of business partners, customers or other third parties. Given the nature of complex systems,
software and services like ours, and the scanning tools that we deploy across our networks and
products, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are prioritized
based on known and anticipated risks, and remediation activities aim to patch within the designated
timeframes. Although we have standard routine patch management processes, we are unable to
comprehensively apply patches or to confirm that mitigating measures are in place to mitigate all such
vulnerabilities, or that any patches will be applied before exploitation by a threat actor. In other
situations, vulnerabilities persist even after we have issued security patches, because our customers
may fail to either apply the patches, update their systems, or authorize service downtime sufficient to
allow for patching by SAP. If attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities before patches are installed or
mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customers’
systems and data.
We could also experience material exposure to our business operations and service delivery due to
disruptions to backups, disaster recovery or business-continuity management processes, or as the
result of malicious or inadvertent actions by threat actors, employees, contractors, or a host of other
parties. Security threats may also exist due to delayed or insufficient responses to identified issues or
other interdependencies such as cloud service providers and those beyond SAP’s cybersecurity
infrastructure and protocols. SAP’s and/or its partners’ lack of sufficient security controls or compliance
with existing controls could impact SAP’s and/or its partners’ ability to comply with applicable
regulations and customer requirements. SAP and/or its partners could unknowingly introduce security
threats and vulnerabilities without established security evaluation processes. Additionally, failure to
integrate or maintain SAP’s cybersecurity infrastructure and protocols with network systems obtained
through acquisitions could result in cyberbreaches, a loss of data confidentiality and integrity, and/or a
loss of system availability.
The foregoing types of events could result in a loss of customers or customer opportunities, a
diminished reputation in the marketplace, government investigations or enforcement actions, internal
investigations, litigation including class actions, fines, or penalties, increased costs associated with
remediation or compliance requirements, required changes to our business model or operations, and
a host of other costs and losses, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows. In
response to the cybersecurity risk environment it is experiencing, SAP is continuously enhancing its
137/324

cybersecurity program, for example by implementing the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and establishing a Cyber Fusion Center (CFC). In
addition, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board continue to increase their governance of and
involvement in cybersecurity matters, for example by focusing on cybersecurity audit and risk
management topics. SAP has established measures intended to address the described risks and
adverse effects, such as the continuous adaptation, standardization, and modification of our security
procedures. This includes, among others: security risk identification, threat modeling, advanced threat
defense, application patches and container security enhancements, and security validation of our
critical components and services before shipment. We increased our investments and resources,
including various internal initiatives to achieve SAP’s objective of ensuring over time that our
cybersecurity infrastructure meets or exceeds evolving industry standards. In addition, we enhanced
the security capabilities in our hosting environment, cloud platforms, and cloud deployment tools,
including improved monitoring to our infrastructure. Disaster recovery and business continuity plans
are in place to protect our key IT infrastructure including implementation of data redundancies and
backup strategies. In addition, we have set up local and regional crisis management teams to respond
and minimize losses in case of crisis situations. Furthermore, we conduct security certifications and
attestations (such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 22301, SOC, and PCI) and provide our customers with
security white papers, product documentation, and reports from independent auditors and
certification bodies. All employees are required to follow the SAP Global Security Policy, security
standards, procedures, and good practices reinforced by completion of mandatory security and
compliance training. SAP’s third-party risk management process aims to control and achieve
governance in SAP’s third-party ecosystem. Besides conducting risk assessments to gauge a third
party’s risk level, we increase employee and contractor awareness through cybersecurity campaigns
and awareness training. Formalized third-party and partner data privacy and security agreements
require adherence to SAP standards. We also engage experts to advise on appropriate cybersecurity
protocols to further increase attention and understanding of cybersecurity procedures and protection
options. SAP also established the CFC to bring functional teams together and strengthen detection
capability. Additionally, the software security development lifecycle with integrated security features
and functionalities has been applied to increase coordination across our various lines of business,
which in turn improves our ability to detect, identify, and respond to threats in a timely manner.
Despite the foregoing measures, we cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks
associated with this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be business-critical and materially
impact our business and results. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely, and classify
this risk factor as high.
Technology and Products: Our technology and products may experience undetected defects,
coding or configuration errors, may not integrate as expected, or may not meet customer
expectations.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: failure of
software products and services to fully meet market needs or customer expectations; failure of
software products and services from acquired companies to fully comply with SAP quality standards;
failure of new products, services, and cloud offerings, including third-party technologies, to comply with
local standards and requirements; the possibility that new products, services, and cloud offerings or
subsequent versions and updates to existing products, services, and cloud offerings might contain
defects or security vulnerabilities, or might not be mature enough from the customer’s point of view for
business-critical solutions, or might not be sufficiently secure after release or shipment despite all the
due diligence SAP puts into quality; inability of algorithms to correctly adapt to evolving circumstances,
which may lead to adverse decision-making processes in the context of AI-related technologies; and
the inability to fulfil expectations of customers regarding time and quality in the defect resolution
process.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such
as: a broad range of techniques, including project management, project monitoring, product standards
and governance, and rigid and regular quality assurance measures certified to ISO 9001:2015; a holistic
testing strategy to validate the state of quality and security for every product before market
138/324

introduction; the consideration of regular and direct customer feedback; and a comprehensive
certification program designed to ensure that relevant third-party solutions are of consistently high
quality.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be business-critical. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be
unlikely, and classify this risk factor as medium.
Strategic Risks
Market Share and Profit: Our market share and profit could decline due to increased
competition, market consolidation, technological innovation, and new business models in the
software industry.
The market for cloud computing is increasingly competitive and is exhibiting strong growth relative to
the market for on-premise solutions. To maintain or improve our operating results in the cloud
business, it is important that we not only attract new customers but also that our existing customers
renew their agreements with us when the initial contract term expires and purchase additional
modules or additional capacity. Additionally, we need to bring innovations to the market in line with the
demands of our ecosystem and ahead of our competitors, such as solutions to support new data-
driven applications and the extension of our suite of intelligent technologies based on SAP Business
Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: inability to
deliver fully suitable solution and transformation services to our customers on the cloud
transformation journey, both in cloud-only and hybrid scenarios; inability to successfully execute on
our hyperscaler strategy; adverse, near-term revenue effects due to increasing cloud business and
conversions from on-premise licenses to cloud subscriptions from existing SAP customers, which
could have an adverse effect on related maintenance and services revenue; insufficient solution and
service adoption together with increased complexity, as well as failures during the execution of our
corporate strategy in the context of our portfolio for solutions and services, which could lead to a loss
of SAP’s position as a leading cloud company and subsequently to reduced customer adoption;
customers and partners being reluctant or unwilling to migrate and adapt to the cloud; customers
considering cloud offerings from our competitors; strategic alliances among competitors; price
pressure, cost increases, and loss of market share through traditional, new, and cooperating
competitors and hyperscalers; and the inability to achieve the planned margin increase in time as
planned.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse
effects. For example, we: share our overall long-term cloud strategy and our integration road map with
our customers; continuously implement improvements to enhance our cloud solutions through our
corporate strategy; demonstrate the benefits of our solution and services portfolio; enable and
support our customers as they transition from on-premise to the cloud; balance the allocation of our
strategic investments by evolving and protecting our core businesses and simultaneously developing
new solutions, technologies, and business models; offer broader range of services to support and
drive the digital transformation for our customers; continuously drive the solution integration and
harmonization of data models to support integrated business processes, applications, and technology
while focusing on resilience, profitability, and sustainability; enable our portfolio for hyperscalers to
extend customer reach and further meet customer expectations; continue to move SAP HANA
Enterprise Cloud towards a full-stack offering; and increase the share of high-value cloud application
services to further improve the margin.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be business-critical. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be
unlikely, and classify this risk factor as medium.
139/324

Mergers and Acquisitions: We might not acquire, integrate, or divest companies or their
components effectively or successfully.
To expand and consolidate our business, we acquire and divest businesses, products, and
technologies, and we expect to continue doing so in the future. Over time, some of these acquisitions
have increased in size and in strategic importance for SAP. Management negotiation of potential
acquisitions and divestures and the integration and carve-out of acquired businesses, products, or
technologies demands time, focus, and resources of both management and the workforce, and
exposes us to unpredictable operational difficulties.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: incorrect
information or assumptions during the due diligence process for acquisitions, divestitures, and other
transactions; failure to integrate acquired technologies or solutions successfully and profitably into
SAP’s solution portfolio and strategy; failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and their
operations; failure to fulfill the needs of the acquired company’s customers or partners; failure to
implement, restore, or maintain internal controls, disclosure controls, and procedures and policies
within acquired companies; debt incurrence or significant unexpected cash expenditures; impairment
of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations; and failure of acquired
companies to comply with regulatory requirements..
We have in the past, and may in the future, choose to divest certain entities, businesses, or product
lines. We may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us. Additionally, we may experience
difficulty carving out portions of or entire businesses, we may incur a loss of revenue or experience a
negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. Such
potential transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur
additional expenses, disrupt customer, partner, and employee relationships, and may expose us to
unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of indemnification obligations.
Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks such as a decline in the
business to be divested, a loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction
may not close, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested as
well as our retained business. If a divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to
find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the
corresponding benefit.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate risks and adverse effects. For
example, we: perform technical, operational, financial, and legal due diligence on the company or
assets to be acquired or divested; identify, implement, and track risk mitigation measures for material
transactions or integration risks; and conduct process, risk, and control analyses that are subsequently
integrated into SAP’s processes and control framework and supported by mitigations as required by
any specific circumstances to subsequently increase adherence to SAP’s standards and policies.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor
were to occur, the impact could be moderate. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be unlikely,
and classify this risk factor as low.
Innovation: We might not be able to compete effectively if we strategize our solution portfolio
ineffectively or if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological and product innovations,
enhancements, new business models, and changing market expectations.
Our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological and process innovations and
new business models, as well as on our ability to develop new products and services, enhance and
expand our existing products and services portfolio, and integrate products and services we obtain
through acquisitions. To be successful, we are required to adapt our products and our go-to-market
approach to a cloud-based delivery and consumption model so as to satisfy increasing customer
demand and to ensure an appropriate level of adoption, customer satisfaction, and retention.
We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others: inability to
develop and sell new cloud products spanning various organizations on time and in line with market
demands due to complexity in heterogeneous technical environments; inability to anticipate and develop
140/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
technological improvements or succeed in adapting SAP products, services, processes, and business
models to technological change, changing regulatory requirements, or emerging industry standards; a
change in requirements of our customers and partners to strengthen the Intelligent Enterprise strategy;
the possibility that our product and technology strategy might not be successful, or that our customers
and partners might not adopt our technology platforms, applications, or cloud services quickly enough, or
that they might consider other competing solutions in the market, or that our strategy might not match
customers’ expectations and needs, specifically in the context of expanding the product portfolio into
additional markets.
We are integrating AI into a number of our products, including our suite of enterprise applications and
SAP BTP, and we expect our use of AI across our portfolio to continue to grow. As with many innovations,
AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business. AI algorithms
or training methodologies may be flawed. Data sets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased
information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or
inadequate AI development or deployment practices by SAP or our partners could result in incidents that
impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our
products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required, which
could introduce error or inefficiencies to the intended use of our AI-enabled offerings. As a result of these
and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could
subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.
In particular, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the applications of intellectual property and
privacy laws to AI technology. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright,
surrounding AI technology have not been fully addressed by courts or other laws or regulations of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, and our use of AI technology or integration of AI technology into our
products and services may result in disputes with respect to ownership or intellectual property, or
exposure to claims of copyright or other intellectual property misappropriation. In addition, our AI
technology may involve the processing of personal and other sensitive data and may be subject to laws,
policies, legal obligations, and contractual requirements related to privacy, data protection, and
information security. Various privacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to obtain consent
or delete certain personal data) and regulate automated decision making. An alleged or actual failure to
meet these obligations may lead to regulatory investigations and fines or penalties; may require us to
change our business practices or retrain our algorithms; or may prevent or limit our use of AI technology. It
is also possible that we are held liable for intellectual property, privacy, or other legal violations of third-
party AI technology that we use, and that we may not have full recourse for any damages that we suffer
(for example, our use of third-party AI technology may be subject to limitations of liability or provide no
liability coverage).
In addition, some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society, and there
can be no assurance that our Global AI Ethics Policy or similar policies and procedures will be sufficient
to address such issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences,
unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their
impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may
experience reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, competitive or
financial position, profit, and cash flows.
SAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects.
For example, we: continuously align our organization, processes, products, delivery, commercial and
consumption models, and services to changing markets and customer and partner demands;
continuously benchmark, match, and challenge the entire portfolio; focus all investment decisions related
to innovative technologies and solutions on portfolio compatibility and readiness as well as high
customer value; explore future trends as well as the latest technologies; conduct wide-ranging market
and technology analyses and research or co-innovation projects; and make strategic acquisitions in white
spots of our portfolio.
We cannot exclude the possibility that if any one or more of the risks associated with this risk factor were
to occur, the impact could be major. We estimate the probability of occurrence to be remote, and classify
this risk factor as low.

Expected Developments and
Opportunities
Future Trends in the Global Economy
Global economic growth will decrease slightly in 2024, mainly reflecting the impact of monetary policy
tightening across advanced economies, projects the European Central Bank (ECB) in its most recent
Economic Bulletin.1 This means that the global economy will expand but still at a rate below the
historical average over the ECB’s projection horizon. With post-COVID-19 growth momentum waning,
the services sector, which had previously proven resilient, might also show a greater deceleration in
2024.
Concerning the EMEA region, economic growth in the euro area might remain subdued in the near
term, as interest rate increases could tighten financing conditions and dampen demand, but at the
same time help push down inflation. However, these effects are likely to fade later on in the projection
period because of rising real incomes and improving foreign demand, suggests the ECB. It also expects
services activity in the EMEA region to soften in the coming months due to spillovers from weaker
industrial activity, fading effects from the reopening of the economy, and the broadening impact of
tighter financing conditions.
As for the Americas region, the ECB predicts that while economic growth in the United States could
moderate in the near term as tighter monetary policy might restrain spending, the U.S. economy should
recover again from the second half of 2024 onward.
For the APJ region, the ECB’s growth outlook remains broadly unrevised with respect to emerging Asia
and China. In China, the ECB projects economic growth to gradually decrease over the coming years
owing to structural factors such as population ageing. In Japan, economic growth might remain positive
but modest in 2024, amid signs of a slight rebound in real consumption levels.

The IT Market: Outlook for 2024 and Beyond
“Organizations that can make smarter investments and better execute on their strategies because of
their digital business platforms will find themselves with a major competitive advantage over the next
five years, leading them to capture significant portions of the digital market share.”2 That is the
assessment of International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market research firm. It projects that
“spending on digital technology by organizations will grow at 7x the economy in 2024, as companies
are compelled by market demands to grow digital business models and strengthen digital
capabilities,”2 and finds that “in a scenario where agility is paramount, a continued reliance on legacy
systems can be detrimental. As we move closer to 2025, organizations must prioritize this transition not
just to be at the forefront of their market but simply to survive.”3
According to IDC, “by early 2025, organizations still on legacy systems will need to modernize their
applications immediately to survive and adapt to the digital world already surpassing them.”3 In
addition, by 2028, “organizations with established digital business platforms will have 50% higher
digital market share with greater abilities to track ROI and execute digital revenue initiatives,”2 and “85%
of CIOs will leverage organizational changes to harness AI, automation, and analytics, driving agile,
insight-driven digital businesses.”4
Concerning sustainability, IDC expects that “by 2027, G2000 organizations’ business and IT leaders will
dedicate at least 20% of their digital tech spending toward sustainability initiatives”, “meeting their
digital goals while taking sustainability into account. These types of sustainability initiatives will increase
in the next five years as significant parts of digital technology investment strategies.”2
In particular, IDC reports that “tools and technologies that facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting
of ESG metrics will be essential” to “mitigate legal risks and enhance their brand and competitive
advantage.”4 It predicts, for example, that “applications that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking
and integrate seamlessly with green supply chain mechanisms will transition from a nice-to-have to a
must-have”3 and that, therefore, “the automation of regulatory compliance will be essential for
monitoring, analyzing, and reporting accurate ESG metrics to meet regulatory standards.”4

Impact on SAP
The global economy is currently impacted by multiple crises, such as political tensions, wars in Ukraine
and the Middle East, disruptions of supply chains, and increasing natural disasters due to climate
change. Nevertheless, SAP’s resilience is remarkable and with 83% of our revenue recurring, the
Company is able to withstand economic pressure to a large degree. Even so, SAP must continue to
evolve and remain agile while continuously adapting to a fast-changing landscape.
In 2024 and beyond, SAP plans to execute along the refined corporate strategy, with increasing focus
on key strategic growth areas, such as cloud adoption, SAP Business AI, and value for customers. This
makes us confident in our ability to expand our addressable market and deliver sustained topline
growth. In addition, given our increased focus on operational efficiency, we are very confident we will
be able to achieve our midterm ambition.

(IN.1) Basis for Preparation
General Information
The registered domicile of SAP SE is in Walldorf, Germany (Commercial Register of the Lower Court of
Mannheim HRB 719915). The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 of SAP SE and its
subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “SAP,” “Group,” and “Company”) have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the additional requirements
set forth in section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).
We have applied all IFRS standards and interpretations that were effective on and endorsed by the
European Union (EU) as at December 31, 2023. There were no standards or interpretations as at
December 31, 2023, impacting our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, that were effective but not yet endorsed. Therefore, our
Consolidated Financial Statements comply with both, IFRS as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as endorsed by the EU.
Our Executive Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements on February 21, 2024, for
submission to our Supervisory Board which approved the Consolidated Financial Statements on the
same day.
All amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in millions of euros
(€ millions) except where otherwise stated. As figures are rounded, numbers presented throughout this
document may not add up precisely to the totals we provide and percentages may not precisely
reflect the absolute figures.

receivables and contract assets allowances, see Note (F.1).
(A.3) Capitalized Cost from Contracts with Customers
Costs of Obtaining Customer Contracts
Capitalized costs from customer contracts are classified as Other non-financial assets in our Statement
of Financial Position.
The capitalized assets for the incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract consist of sales
commissions earned by our sales force and partners as well as amounts paid to employees with non-
sales roles when the payments meet the definition of being an incremental cost to obtain a contract
with a customer. Judgment is required in determining the amounts to be capitalized, particularly where
the commissions are based on cumulative targets and where commissions relate to multiple
performance obligations in one customer contract. We capitalize such cumulative target commissions
for all customer contracts that count towards the cumulative target but only if nothing other than
obtaining customer contracts can contribute to achieving the cumulative target. Commissions for
contracts with multiple performance obligations or for probable renewals thereof are allocated to
these performance obligations and probable renewals relative to the respective standalone selling
price.
Our sales commission payments for customer contract renewals are typically not commensurate with
the commissions paid for new contracts. Thus, the commissions paid for renewable new contracts also
relate to expected renewals of these contracts. Consequently, we amortize sales commissions paid for
new customer contracts on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life including probable
contract renewals. Judgment is required in estimating these contract lives. In exercising this judgment,
we consider our expectation about future contract renewals which we evaluate periodically to confirm
that the resulting amortization period properly reflects the expected contract life or if there are
potential indicators of impairment. Commensurate payments are amortized over the contract term to
which they relate.
The amortization periods range from 18 months to seven years depending on the type of offering.
Amortization of the capitalized costs of obtaining customer contracts is classified mainly as sales and
marketing expense. We expense the incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract as incurred if
we expect an amortization period of one year or less.
The regular review of the amortization periods resulted in a shorter contract life for on-premise
support contracts and consequently in an accelerated amortization of costs related to these contracts.
This results, for capitalized cost of obtaining customer contracts as of December 31, 2023, in higher
amortization expenses amounting to €121 million for 2023 and approximately €80 million for 2024.

Costs to Fulfill Customer Contracts
Capitalized costs incurred to fulfill customer contracts mainly consist of direct costs for set-up and
implementation of cloud products and custom cloud development contracts as far as these costs are
not in scope of other accounting standards than IFRS 15. These costs are amortized after completion
of the setup and implementation or the development, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the
expected life of the cloud subscription contract including expected renewals. For the life of the
contract, we consider our expectation about future contract renewals which we evaluate periodically
to confirm that the resulting amortization period properly reflects the expected contract life. The
amortization periods range from five to eight years depending on the type of offering. In addition, the
capitalized costs include third-party license fees which are amortized over the term of the third-party
license contract. Judgment is required in evaluating whether costs are directly related to customer
contracts and in estimating contract lives.
Amortization of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts for custom cloud applications and extensions is
included in the cost of cloud.

(A.4) Customer-Related Provisions
Expected Contract Losses
Customer-related provisions mainly include expected contract losses. We adjust these provisions as
further information becomes available and as circumstances change. Non-current provisions are
measured at the present value of their expected settlement amounts as at the reporting date.
The unit of account for the identification of potential onerous customer contracts is based on the
contract definition of IFRS 15 including the contract combination guidance. The economic benefits
considered in the assessment comprise the future benefits we are directly entitled to under the
contract as well as the anticipated future benefits that are the economic consequence of the contract
if these benefits can be reliably determined.
Customer-Related Litigation and Claims
Customer-related provisions also include obligations resulting from customer-related litigation and
claims. We are currently confronted with various claims and legal proceedings, including claims that
relate to customers demanding indemnification for proceedings initiated against them based on their
use of SAP software, and occasionally claims that relate to customers being dissatisfied with the
169/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
products and services that we have delivered to them. The obligations arising from customer-related
litigation and claims comprise cases in which we indemnify our customers against liabilities arising
from a claim that our products infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, or other
proprietary rights.
Due to uncertainties relating to these matters, provisions are based on the best information available.
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether and when a provision is to be
recorded and what the appropriate amount for such provision should be. Notably, judgment is
required in the following areas:
– Determining whether an obligation exists
– Determining the probability of outflow of economic benefits
– Determining whether the amount of an obligation is reliably estimable
– Estimating the amount of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation
At the end of each reporting period, we reassess the potential obligations related to our pending
claims and litigation and adjust our respective provisions to reflect the current best estimate. In
addition, we monitor and evaluate new information that we receive after the end of the respective
reporting period, but before the Consolidated Financial Statements are authorized for issue, to
determine whether this provides additional information regarding conditions that existed at the end of
the reporting period. Changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our accounting for legal
contingencies, and outcomes that differ from these estimates and assumptions, could require material
adjustments to the carrying amounts of the respective provisions recorded and additional provisions.
The expected timing or amounts of any outflows of economic benefits resulting from these lawsuits
and claims are uncertain and not estimable, as they generally depend on the duration of the legal
proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve the litigation and claims and the
unpredictability of the outcomes of legal disputes in several jurisdictions.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of customer-related litigation and claims for which no provision
has been recognized. It is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these contingent liabilities
due to the uncertainties around these lawsuits and claims as outlined above.

(B.3) Share-Based Payments
Accounting for Share-Based Payments
Classification in the Income Statement
Share-based payments cover equity-settled and cash-settled awards issued to our employees. The
respective expenses are recognized as employee benefits and classified in our Consolidated Income
Statements according to the activities that the receiving employees perform.
Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
We use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including
expected share price volatility and expected dividend yields. In addition, the final number of
Performance Share Units (PSUs) vesting also depends on the achievement of performance indicators.
Furthermore, the payout for cash-settled share units depends on our share price on the respective
vesting dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could
require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these
share-based payments. The fair value of the share units granted under the SAP Long-Term Incentive
Program 2020 (LTI 2020) is dependent on our performance against the total shareholder return (TSR)
for NASDAQ-100 companies, the volatility, and the expected correlation between the TSR of the
NASDAQ-100 companies and our TSR.
Regarding future payout under our cash-settled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor.
With respect to our LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by
our share price but also by the relative TSR performance against the NASDAQ-100 companies. Future
payouts under our LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance
conditions based on SAP’s long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair
value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted. Changes in these factors
could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future
payout.
Under the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we grant our employees discounts on share purchases. As
those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount
is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted.
Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows
We present the payments of our cash-settled share-based payment plans separately in our
Statements of Cash Flows under Cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the changes in other
assets and in other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow do not consider
share-based payment-related assets or liabilities.
The operating expense line items in our income statement include the following share-based payment
expenses:

Uncertainty in Context of Legal Matters
The policies outlined in Note (A.4) for customer-related provisions, which include provisions for
customer-related litigation cases and claims, equally apply to our other litigation, claims, and legal
contingencies disclosed in this Note.
The outcome of litigation and claims is intrinsically subject to considerable uncertainty. Management’s
view of these matters may also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and claims may differ
from the assessments made by management in prior periods, which could result in a material impact
on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or reputation. Most of the lawsuits and claims are
of a very individual nature and claims are either not quantified by the claimants or the claim amounts
237/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
quantified are, based on historical evidence, not expected to be a good proxy for the expenditure that
would be required to resolve the case concerned. The specifics of the jurisdictions where most of the
claims are located further impair the predictability of the outcome of the cases. Therefore, it is typically
not practicable to reliably estimate the financial effect that these lawsuits and claims would have if
SAP were to incur expenditure for these cases.
Further, the expected timing of any resulting outflows of economic benefits from these lawsuits and
claims is typically uncertain and not estimable, as it depends generally on the duration of the legal
proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve them.
We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of
our business, including proceedings and claims that relate to companies we have acquired. We will
continue to vigorously defend against all claims and lawsuits against us. The provisions recorded for
these claims and lawsuits as at December 31, 2023, are neither individually nor in the aggregate
material to SAP.
Among the claims and lawsuits disclosed in this Note are the following classes:
Intellectual Property-Related Litigation and Claims
Intellectual property-related litigation and claims are cases in which third parties have threatened or
initiated litigation claiming that SAP violates one or more intellectual property rights that they possess.
Such intellectual property rights may include patents, copyrights, and other similar rights.
Contingent liabilities exist from intellectual property-related litigation and claims for which no provision
has been recognized. Generally, it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these
contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around the litigation and claims, as outlined above. Based
on our past experience, most of the intellectual property-related litigation and claims tend to be either
dismissed in court or settled out of court for amounts significantly below the originally claimed
amounts. We currently believe that resolving the intellectual property-related claims and lawsuits
pending as at December 31, 2023, will neither individually nor in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, profit, or cash flows.
Individual cases of intellectual property-related litigation and claims include the following:
In June 2018, Teradata Corporation, Teradata US, Inc. and Teradata Operations, Inc. (collectively
“Teradata”) filed a civil lawsuit against SAP SE, SAP America, Inc., and SAP Labs, LLC in U.S. federal court
in California. Teradata alleged that SAP had misappropriated trade secrets of Teradata, had infringed
Teradata’s copyrights (this claim was subsequently withdrawn by Teradata), and had violated U.S.
antitrust laws. Teradata sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. In 2019, SAP
asserted patent infringement counterclaims against Teradata seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief. In 2020, Teradata initiated a second civil lawsuit against SAP asserting patent
infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief; in February 2021, SAP filed patent
infringement counterclaims against Teradata in this second U.S. lawsuit as well as a civil lawsuit against
Teradata in Germany asserting patent infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief.
Currently, all claims between the parties have been dismissed. Teradata has appealed the dismissal of
its trade secret and antitrust claims; this appeal is expected to be completed by late 2024.
Tax-Related Litigation
We are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In respect of non-income
taxes, we are involved in various proceedings with only a few foreign tax authorities regarding
assessments and litigation matters on intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. The
total potential amount in dispute related to these matters for all applicable years is approximately
€416 million (2022: €344 million). We have not recorded a provision for these matters, as we believe
that we will prevail.
For more information about our income tax-related litigation, see Note (C.5).

Anti-Bribery Matters
SAP has received communications and whistleblower information alleging conduct that may violate
anti-bribery laws in the United States (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)) and in
other countries. SAP’s Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC) conducted investigations with the
assistance of an external law firm and voluntarily advised the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (U.S. SEC), the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), and local authorities where potential
violations were investigated. In early January 2024, following comprehensive and exhaustive
investigations, dialogue, and corresponding remediation activities, SAP entered into final settlement
agreements with U.S. SEC and U.S. DOJ, as well as with local authorities and parties in South Africa, to
resolve criminal and civil claims fully and finally against SAP. Under these agreements, SAP is required
to make payments amounting to €207 million. As a consequence, as at December 31, 2023, provisions
for fines in regulatory compliance matters totaling €155 million (December 31, 2022: €0 million,
June 30, 2023: €170 million) were recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements as well as
repayments to customers, for which revenue recognized from contracts with customers have been
reversed. A considerable portion of these repayments to customers was eligible to be credited against
the fines incurred in the regulatory compliance matters. Immaterial amounts were already paid in 2022.
The remaining payments will be made to a large extent within the first half of 2024.

(G.7) Principal Accountant Fees and Services
At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 18, 2022, our shareholders elected
the Company’s principal auditor since the fiscal year 2023. Dr. Jens Freiberg has signed as auditor
responsible for the audit of the financial reporting and the group reporting of SAP SE since the fiscal
year 2023.
For prior fiscal years since 2002, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was the Company’s
principal auditor and Bodo Rackwitz signed as auditor responsible for the audit of the financial
BDO and other firms in the global BDO network charged the following fees to SAP for audit and other
professional services related to 2023 (KPMG for previous years):

BDO AG is due to a centralized audit approach. Further, BDO Germany has engaged local BDO
network firms to audit financial information of subsidiaries as part of the audit of our consolidated
financial statements. Audit-related fees are fees charged by BDO for assurance and related services
that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit and for service organization attestation
procedures.

Organizational Changes
On January 9, 2024, SAP announced several organizational changes. Muhammad Alam was appointed
a member of the Executive Board effective April 1, 2024, and a new Board area called Customer
Services & Delivery will be formed under the leadership of Thomas Saueressig. The announced
organizational changes might result in a change in SAP’s operating segments.
Settlement to Resolve Criminal and Civil Claims in United States and
South Africa Fully and Finally Against SAP
In early January 2024, following exhaustive investigations, dialogue, and corresponding remediation
activities, SAP entered into final settlement agreements with the U.S. SEC and U.S. DOJ, as well with as
local authorities and parties in South Africa, to resolve criminal and civil claims fully and finally against
SAP. For more information, see Note (G.3).

Transformation Program 2024: Focus on Scalability of Operations and Key
Strategic Growth Areas
In 2024, SAP will further increase its focus on key strategic growth areas, in particular business AI. It also
intends to transform its operational setup to capture organizational synergies, and AI-driven
efficiencies and prepare the Company for highly scalable future revenue growth.
To this end, and to ensure that SAP’s skill set and resources continue to meet future business needs,
8,000 affected positions is expected to be covered by voluntary leave programs and internal re-skilling
headcount similar to current levels.
Restructuring expenses are preliminarily projected at around €2 billion, the vast majority of which is
expected to be recognized in the first half of 2024, impacting IFRS operating profit. Excluding
restructuring expenses, the program is expected to provide only a minor cost benefit in 2024.

# Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments

in this Note (B.3). Obligations from
outstanding share units granted before 2022 will continue to be settled in cash.
From 2020 to 2023, we granted share units under the Grow SAP Plan that we intend to settle in cash.
This fixed term plan has broadly the same terms and conditions as Move and recognizes all
employees’ commitment to SAP’s success, and deepens their participation in our future company
performance.
Different vesting schedules apply to specific share units. Granted share units under the respective
plans will vest in different tranches, mainly as follows:
– Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) with service condition only
▪ Over a half-year period,
▪ Over a three-year period on annual basis,
▪ Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of six months, or
– Performance Share Units (PSUs) with service condition and upon achieving certain key
performance indicators (KPIs)
▪ Over a three-year period, or
▪ Over a three-year period on a quarterly basis after a waiting period of 12 months.
The number of PSUs that will vest under the different tranches is mainly contingent upon achievement
of two equally weighted KPIs in the year of grant: operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) and
cloud revenue (at constant currencies). Depending on the weighted average performance, the number
of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted. Performance against the
KPI target was 112.4% in 2023 (2022: 84.3%, 2021: 130.9%).
The share units classified as cash-settled are paid out in cash upon vesting.
The LTI 2020 is a long-term, multiyear performance-based element of our Executive Board
compensation that is granted in annual tranches. The LTI 2020 reflects SAP’s long-term strategy and
thus sets uniform incentives to achieve key targets from the long-term strategic plans. The LTI 2020 also
serves to reward the Executive Board members for long-term SAP share price performance as
compared to the market, thus ensuring that shareholders’ interests are also honored. In addition, the
LTI 2020 includes a component to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members.
The LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four
years each are granted. When the individual tranches are granted, a certain grant amount specified in
the Executive Board member’s service contract is converted into virtual shares (share units). For this
purpose, the grant amount is divided by the price of the SAP share which corresponds to the
arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the
preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price). The share units
175/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
allocated are composed of 1/3 Financial Performance Share Units (FSUs), 1/3 Market Performance
Share Units (MSUs), and 1/3 Retention Share Units. All three types of share units have a vesting period
of approximately four years. In contrast to Retention Share Units, FSUs and MSUs are subject to
changes in quantity. In this context, the following applies:
The number of FSUs initially awarded is multiplied by a performance factor. The performance factor
consists of three equally weighted individual performance indicators relating to the three non-IFRS
KPIs at constant currencies, derived from SAP’s long-term strategy: total revenue, cloud revenue, and
operating income. The performance period throughout which the target achievement for these three
KPIs is measured starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the FSUs are awarded and
concludes upon the end of the second year following the year in which the share units were awarded.
A numerical target value equaling 100% target achievement is set for each KPI. This constitutes, in each
case, a cumulative value for the three years of the performance period.
The number of MSUs initially awarded is likewise multiplied by a performance factor. The performance
factor depends on the amount of the TSR on the SAP share, measured for an entire performance
period of approximately three years, compared to the TSR for NASDAQ-100 companies. If the TSR on
the SAP share equals the median, the performance factor will be 100%. If the TSR on the SAP share
over the performance period is negative, the maximum performance factor will, however, in deviation
from the summary above, be 100%.
The performance of the share units is linked to the performance of the SAP share price, including
dividend payments. Accordingly, an amount is paid out for each share unit which equals the SAP share
price plus those dividends disbursed in respect of an SAP share in the period from the beginning of
the year in which the share units were awarded until the end of the third year following the year in
which the share units were awarded. The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading
days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a
176/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
whole will be used as the SAP share price. The payout amount per share unit, including the dividend
amounts due on the share units, is capped at 200% of the grant price. The tranche is cash-settled and
paid in euros after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the corresponding year.
If an Executive Board member’s service contract is terminated before the end of the third year
following the year in which the share units were granted, the Retention Share Units and PSUs are
forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or
termination of the service contract.
Long-Term Incentive 2016 Plan (LTI 2016 Plan)
The purpose of the LTI 2016 Plan was to reward our Executive Board members for the annual
achievement of SAP’s Operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) targets, to ensure long-term
retention of our Executive Board members, and to reward them for the long-term SAP share price
performance as compared to its main peer group (Peer Group). An LTI tranche was granted annually
and had a term of four years (2016–2019 tranches).
All share units granted in this way, comprising 60% PSUs and 40% Retention Share Units, had a vesting
period of approximately four years. At the end of the vesting period, the corresponding share units
were non-forfeitable. The payout price used for the settlement was the arithmetic mean of the XETRA
closing prices of the SAP share on the 20 trading days following the publication of SAP’s fourth-quarter
results subsequent to the end of the vesting period. The payout price was capped at 300% of the
grant price. The number of PSUs ultimately paid out was dependent on the performance of the SAP
share – absolute and relative to the Peer Group Index. The LTI tranche was cash-settled and paid in
euros after the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of the corresponding year. The last LTI tranche
2019 was paid out in 2023.
The valuation was based on the following parameters and assumptions:

(B.4) Pension Plans and Similar Obligations
Defined Contribution Plans
Amounts for domestic and foreign defined contribution plans are based on a percentage of the
employees’ salaries or on the amount of contributions made by employees. In Germany and some
other countries, we make contributions to public pension schemes that are operated by national or
local government or similar institutions. Expenses for such local state pension plans are recognized as
short-term employee benefits, that is, social security expenses.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The discount rates used in measuring our post-employment benefit assets and liabilities are derived
from rates available on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds for which the timing and
amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension payments. Net
interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized as employee
benefits expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities
that the employees owning the awards perform. Since our domestic defined benefit pension plans
primarily consist of an employee-financed post-retirement plan that is fully financed with qualifying
insurance policies, current service cost may become a credit as a result of adjusting the defined
benefit liability’s carrying amount to the fair value of the qualifying plan assets. Such adjustments are
recorded in service cost. Total expenses on defined benefit pension plans comprise related current
and past service costs as well as interest income and expense.

Investments in Plan Assets
Our investment strategy on domestic benefit plans is to invest all contributions in stable insurance
policies.
Our investment strategies for foreign benefit plans vary according to the conditions in the country in
which the respective benefit plans are situated. We have adopted a long-term investment horizon for
all major foreign benefit plans. Although our policy is to invest in a risk-diversified portfolio consisting of
a mix of assets, both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets can fluctuate over time, which
exposes the Group to actuarial and market (investment) risks. Depending on the statutory
requirements in each country, it might be necessary to reduce any underfunding by addition of liquid
assets.

Our expected contribution in 2024 to our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans is
immaterial. The weighted duration of our defined benefit plans amounted to 10 years as at
December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Total future benefit payments from our defined benefit plans as at December 31, 2023, are expected
to be €2,707 million (2022: €2,404 million). Of this amount, 76% (2022: 76%) have maturities of over five
years, and 55% (2022: 61%) relate to domestic plans.

security expenses, severance payments outside restructuring programs, and jubilee expenses.
(B.6) Restructuring
Recognition of Restructuring Provisions
We only recognize provisions for restructuring if and when the following occurs:
– SAP has designed a program that materially changes the scope of one of our businesses or the
manner in which the business is conducted, and
– A detailed and documented restructuring plan has been approved by our Executive Board, a
member thereof, or a direct report of an Executive Board member, and
– The program established is planned to start shortly after the program plan is approved and is
expected to be completed in a timeframe that makes significant changes to the plan unlikely, and
– The program has been announced to the parties affected or has commenced.
We consider whether a change in business is material based on the business affected rather than for
SAP as a whole. In judging whether a unit qualifies as a business for restructuring purposes, we
consider if the unit has its own management team, has access to all inputs and processes necessary to
provide outputs, and generates or could generate revenues. The materiality of a change to a business
is assessed based on both the size and the nature of the change and therefore does not necessarily
involve a material quantitative impact on our financial statements.

Most of the restructuring expenses recognized in 2023 relate to the targeted restructuring program in
focus on its strategic growth areas and accelerated cloud transformation. Restructuring expenses
primarily include employee-related benefits such as severance payments. The restructuring costs
presented in 2022 mainly include expenses related to the wind-down of business in Russia and
Belarus.
If not presented separately in our income statement, restructuring expenses would have been
classified in the different expense items in our income statement as follows:

Section C – Financial Results
This section provides insight into the financial results of SAP’s reportable segments and of SAP overall
as far as not already covered by previous sections. This includes but is not limited to segment results,
income taxes, and earnings per share.
(C.1) Results of Segments
General Information
At year end 2023, SAP had five operating segments that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board,
which is responsible for assessing the performance of the Company and for making resource
allocation decisions as our chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The operating segments are
largely organized and managed separately according to their product and service offerings. The
Applications, Technology & Services (ATS) segment is SAP’s only reportable segment.
In the first quarter of 2023, the non-reportable SAP Signavio segment was dissolved and integrated
into the Applications, Technology & Services segment.
At the end of the second quarter of 2023, we sold our stake in Qualtrics, a formerly reportable
segment. For more information about the sale of Qualtrics, see Note (D.1).
Due to their size, the following segments are non-reportable:
– The Emarsys segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of cloud-based customer
experience offerings and from the sale of related services.
– The Taulia segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of working capital solutions.
– The Business Network segment combines SAP’s network offerings, covering procurement, logistics,
asset management, and industry-specific solutions spanning end-to-end value chains. The segment
generates revenues from cloud application subscriptions, transactional fees, and services.
– The Sustainability segment bundles a portfolio of sustainability-related solutions that enables SAP’s
customers to record and report financial and non-financial metrics and act on improving their
sustainability footprint across all ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dimensions.
The segment information for 2023 and the comparative prior periods were restated to conform with
the new segment composition.
Segment Reporting Policies
Our management reporting system, and hence our segment reporting system, reports our
intersegment services as cost reductions and does not track them as internal revenue. Intersegment
services mainly represent utilization of human resources of one segment by another segment on a
project basis. Intersegment services are charged based on internal cost rates including certain indirect
overhead costs but excluding a profit margin.
Most of our depreciation and amortization expense affecting segment profits is allocated to the
segments as part of broader infrastructure allocations and is thus not tracked separately on the
operating segment level. Other depreciation and amortization expense is directly allocated to the
operating segments.
Our management reporting system produces a variety of reports that differ by the currency exchange
rates used in the accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations, where both actual and
constant currency numbers are reported to and used by our CODM. Reports based on actual
currencies use the same currency rates as are used in our financial statements. Reports based on
183/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
constant currencies report revenues and expenses using the average exchange rates from the previous
year’s corresponding period.
We use an operating profit indicator to measure the performance of our operating segments. The
accounting policies applied in the measurement of operating segment expenses and profit differ as
follows from the IFRS accounting principles used to determine the operating profit measure in our
income statement:
The expense measures exclude:
– Acquisition-related charges such as amortization expense and impairment charges for intangibles
acquired in business combinations, including goodwill impairment charges, and certain stand-alone
acquisitions of intellectual property (including purchased in-process research and development) as
well as sale/disposal gains and losses for these intangibles, settlements of pre-existing business
relationships in connection with a business combination, and acquisition-related third-party
expenses
– Share-based payment expenses
– Restructuring expenses
– Regulatory compliance matter expenses
SAP headquarter functions which are exclusively managed on corporate level, such as finance,
accounting, legal, human resources, global business operations, and corporate marketing, are not
included in the results of our reportable segments.

The decrease in deferred tax assets for contract liabilities and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities
for intangible assets mainly result from the divestiture of Qualtrics.
The increase in deferred tax assets for other in the amount of €236 million (2022: €169 million) and in
deferred tax liabilities for trade and other receivables in the amount of €492 million
(2022: €288 million), as well as the decrease in deferred tax liabilities for other in the amount of
€292 million (2022: €140 million), mainly result from reclassifications, leading to a more consistent
presentation of the components of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. The presentation for
2022 remains unchanged in this respect.

Of the unused tax losses, €181 million (2022: €276 million; 2021: €183 million) relate to U.S. state tax

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately €22.15 billion (2022: €28.91 billion)
for undistributed profits of our subsidiaries, because we are in a position to control the timing of the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Income Tax-Related Litigation
We are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Currently, we are in
dispute mainly with the German and only a few foreign tax authorities. The German dispute is in
respect of certain secured capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are mainly in respect of
the deductibility of intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. In all cases, we expect
that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through litigation. For all of these matters, we have not
recorded a provision as we believe that the tax authorities’ claims have no merit and that no
adjustment is warranted. If, contrary to our view, the tax authorities were to prevail in their arguments
before the court, we would expect to have an additional expense of approximately €1,815 million
(2022: €1,607 million) in total (including related interest expenses and penalties of €1,003 million
(2022: €881 million)).
Reform of International Taxation Rules
In October 2021, over 135 jurisdictions agreed on a new framework for the international tax system
covering the re-allocation of taxing rights and the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax rate.
In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released
model rules, which shall ensure that multinational enterprises with revenue above €750 million will be
subject to a 15% minimum corporate tax rate. In December 2022, the Member States of the European
Union (EU) adopted a directive on a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise
groups and large-scale domestic groups in the EU. By the end of 2023, Germany transposed the EU
190/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
directive into national law, applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023. SAP has
performed an assessment of its potential exposure to the global minimum tax legislation. This
assessment is based on our current understanding of the global minimum taxation rules and on the
most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the constituent entities within
SAP. Our simulation reveals that SAP should not be materially affected. SAP has applied the temporary
mandatory exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and
liabilities related to the global minimum tax.

Time deposits with original maturity of three months or less are presented as cash and cash
equivalents, and those with original maturities of greater than three months (investments considered in
group liquidity) are presented as other financial assets. Debt securities consist of acquired commercial
papers and acquired bonds of mainly financial and non-financial corporations and municipalities.
The increase in time deposits presented as cash equivalents and current investments and the increase
in money market funds in 2023 are due to the proceeds from the Qualtrics divestiture.

# Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure

Our risk exposure is based on the following assumptions:
– The SAP Group’s entities generally operate in their functional currencies. In exceptional cases and
limited economic environments, operating transactions are denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency, leading to a foreign currency exchange rate risk for the related monetary
instruments. Where material, this foreign currency exchange rate risk is hedged. Therefore,
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates only have an impact on profit with regard to our
unhedged non-derivative monetary financial instruments and related income or expenses.
– Our free-standing derivatives designed for hedging foreign currency exchange rate risks almost
completely balance the changes in the fair values of the hedged item attributable to exchange rate
movements in the Consolidated Income Statements in the same period. As a consequence, the
hedged items and the hedging instruments are not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks,
and thereby have no effect on profit.
Consequently, we are only exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with
regard to the following:
220/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
– The spot component of derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge relationship affecting
other comprehensive income
– Foreign currency embedded derivatives affecting other non-operating expense, net
– Unhedged foreign-currency monetary assets and liabilities affecting other non-operating expense,
net
Thus, our foreign currency exposure (and our average/high/low exposure) as at December 31 was as
follows:
Foreign Currency Exposure

Interest Rate Sensitivity
A sensitivity analysis is provided to show the impact of our interest rate risk exposure on profit or loss
and equity in accordance with IFRS 7, considering the following:
– Changes in interest rates only affect the accounting for non-derivative fixed-rate financial
instruments if they are recognized at fair value. Therefore, such interest rate changes do not change
the carrying amounts of our non-derivative fixed-rate financial liabilities, as we account for them at
amortized cost. Investments in fixed-rate financial assets classified as fair value through profit or
223/324

To Our Combined Management Consolidated Financial Further Information about Additional
Stakeholders Report Statements IFRS Sustainability Information
loss were not material at each year end reported. Thus, we do not consider any fixed-rate
instruments in the equity-related sensitivity calculation.
– Income or expenses recorded in connection with non-derivative financial instruments with variable
interest rates are subject to interest rate risk if they are not hedged items in an effective hedge
relationship. Thus, we take into consideration interest rate changes relating to our variable-rate
financing and our investments in money market instruments in the profit-related sensitivity
calculation.
– The designation of interest rate receiver swaps in a fair value hedge relationship leads to interest
rate changes affecting Financial income, net. The fair value movements related to the interest rate
swaps are not reflected in the sensitivity calculation, as they offset the fixed interest rate payments
for the bonds and private placements as hedged items. However, changes in market interest rates
affect the amount of interest payments from the interest rate swap. As a consequence, we include
those effects of market interest rates on interest payments in the profit-related sensitivity
calculation.
If, on December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, interest rates had been higher/lower this would have had
the following effects on Financial income, net.
