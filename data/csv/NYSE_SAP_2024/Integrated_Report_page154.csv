(wood) during its life cycle. The reporting of these emissions is separate from the mandatory GHG
Emissions Scope 1.
GHG Emissions Scope 2 (location- and market-based)
Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions and is defined as GHG emissions from the consumption of
"purchased electricity, purchased steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from the"
organization. We calculate GHG Emissions Scope 2 following both a location-based and market-based
"approach. To calculate the GHG Emissions Scope 2 (market-based), we have applied a regional energy"
attribute certificates (EACs) portfolio approach (see Energy Consumption and Mix above).
"At SAP, the following emission categories are covered by Scope 2:"
- Electricity in office buildings: GHG emissions caused by the consumption of purchased
electricity in office buildings. GHG emissions are calculated based on building electricity
"consumption. CO e conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid
2"
"factors. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous"
year’s energy consumption data are used for extrapolation.
- Electricity in SAP-owned data centers: GHG emissions caused by the consumption of
purchased electricity in SAP-owned and -managed data centers. GHG emissions are calculated
"based on data center electricity consumption (100% data coverage). CO e conversion factors are
2"
updated annually based on country-specific grid factors.
- Electricity in colocation data centers: GHG emissions caused by the consumption of purchased
electricity in colocation data centers. A colocation is a local computing center whose building
infrastructure is controlled and managed by an external provider but where SAP has control over
"the operations of the network and server infrastructure on which SAP software runs. CO e
2"
conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid factors. Electricity
consumption for colocation data centers is calculated based on the consumed IT infrastructure
"power and a power usage effectiveness (PUE) factor. Where no data is available, average factors"
are applied.
- E-mobility: GHG emissions from company cars with electric drivetrains. Electricity consumption is
"calculated based on the number of electric cars per country, an average energy consumption"
"value for electric cars, and an average mileage per year. GHG emissions are calculated based on"
country-specific emission factors.
"- Purchased chilled and hot water, and steam: GHG emissions caused by the consumption of"
purchased heat or steam in office buildings (district heating). GHG emissions are calculated
based on the consumption of district heating. Emission factors are updated annually. Where no
"measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous year’s energy"
consumption data are used for extrapolation.
"- Home office electricity: Starting in 2024, we will no longer include GHG emissions caused by"
end-user IT equipment used by SAP employees working from home in our reporting. Compared to
"SAP’s Total Energy Consumption, the amount of electricity used by our employees working"
"remotely is insignificant. In addition, SAP has implemented a strict return-to-office policy in 2024,"
which will reduce the energy consumption and corresponding GHG emissions even further going
"forward. The change in reporting has no effect on SAP’s net zero target and baseline, since the net-"
zero target and baseline are market-based and GHG emissions relating to remote work had been
100% compensated by the purchase of renewable energy certificates.
GHG Emissions Scope 3 Upstream and Downstream
"Scope 3 refers to other indirect GHG emissions, which are defined as GHG emissions that are a"
consequence of the operations of an organization that it does not directly own or control. GHG
Emissions Scope 3 are divided into Upstream and Downstream emissions.
GHG Emissions Scope 3 Upstream
- Business flights: GHG emissions caused by business trips by airplane. These GHG emissions are
calculated based on actual distance traveled and DEFRA factors. DEFRA adjusted their aviation
factors to account for reduced load factors as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since
"the load factors in 2024 are almost back to pre-COVID level, we used the factor from the previous"
