over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Our judgment regarding future
taxable income is based on assumptions about future market conditions and future profits of SAP.

tax assets and liabilities related to the global minimum tax.
Judgment is also required in evaluating whether interest or penalties related to income taxes meet the
"definition of income taxes, and, if not, whether it is of financial nature. In this judgment, we particularly"
consider applicable local tax laws and interpretations on IFRS by national standard setters in the area
of group financial reporting.
