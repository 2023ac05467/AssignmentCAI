"internal, colocation, and hyperscale providers data center electricity GHG emissions. Mobile solutions"
"(for example, SAP apps running on customer IT equipment) are also not included."
SAP aims to constantly improve its calculation method. We will adapt the parameters we use when
"significant technology changes occur, or more accurate data sources become available."
Excluded GHG Emissions Scope 3 Upstream and Downstream
The following sources of GHG Emissions Scope 3 Upstream and Downstream are not applicable or
"are insignificant to SAPâ€™s business operations: Downstream transportation and distribution, processing"
"of sold products, end-of-life treatment of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchises, and"
"investments. Additionally, the upstream leased assets category is not relevant for SAP, since we have"
classified GHG emissions resulting from leased assets as GHG Emissions Scope 1 and 2 (location- and
market-based) following the operational control approach of the GHG Protocol.
