We want all of our people to be paid fairly and
"equitably. In 2022, we began to make annual global"
pay adjustments to ensure that the compensation of at
least 99% employees is within their pay ranges and
equitable among comparable peers.1 We are meeting
that target (using data after the annual adjustments). In
"addition, we have met our target of pay range"
transparency (99.9% of employees) and we continue
to assess this. 1 We are targeting a full action plan in
relation to the EU Pay Transparency Directive by 2026.
We work with social partners and employee
"representatives to set our payment related targets, to"
"assess our pay practices, and to identify areas for"
improvement. We inform them about our performance
against targets if legally required.
