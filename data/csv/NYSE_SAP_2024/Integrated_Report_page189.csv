Annual Total Remuneration Ratio
"In determining the annual total remuneration ratio, we utilize the total target cash on a full-time basis,"
"which includes both base salaries and target bonuses as of December 31, 2024. This approach"
ensures that the compensation of part-time employees is accurately reflected. We also include the LTI
"that has been granted to the individual employees during the reporting year, valued at grant date.10"
"To calculate the annual total remuneration ratio, we first identify the employee with the median"
"compensation, including Executive Board members, but excluding the highest-paid employee. For a"
"more comprehensive analysis, we also incorporate benefits for the median employee, as well as for"
five employees above and below the median. These 11 data points are then averaged to calculate the
remuneration of the median employee and compare it with the highest-paid employee.
