D&I goals align with several UN Sustainable
"Development Goals (SDGs): Gender equality (SDG 5),"
"Reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and Decent work and"
economic growth (SDG 8).
"At SAP, we are committed to fostering equality by"
achieving our goal of industry-based gender parity at
all levels within our organization. SAP is on track to
achieving its long-term gender goals in compliance
with applicable legal requirements.

SAP’s commitment to industry-based gender equality
in leadership is a key topic of concern for investors
and has financial implications given that it is an ESG
KPI for the revolving credit facility (RCF). A key enabler
for driving change is the commitment from the
Executive Board members and other executives who
appoint people to these leadership roles.
""
The aspirational targets are proposed annually by the
Global Diversity & Inclusion Office (GDIO) and are
considered under SAP's overall growth plan and the
Talent Discovery hiring target for the year. The GDIO
also considers labor market data and past trends to
arrive at the proposed targets. The proposal is
"presented to the Executive Board for approval, and"
"relevant stakeholders, including the Supervisory"
"Board Committee, are informed of the changes. The"
approved targets are then shared both internally and
externally.
""
""
Annual disclosure of the targets through the SAP
Diversity & Inclusion report and the Integrated Report.
Monthly tracking and quarterly updates are also
provided to the Executive Board and Supervisory
"Board on all of the KPIs. From those updates, lessons"
or improvements based on the performance can be
identified. Publishing D&I KPIs twice a year enables
the senior leadership team to review and change
course to meet the targets set for D&I.

There is no target related to this positive impact.
"Usage of accommodations, feedback from employees"
"via Employee Network Groups, surveys like the Global"
"Diversity Survey, and the number of colleagues self-"
disclosing their disability status will continue to help
measure the effectiveness of these initiatives.
