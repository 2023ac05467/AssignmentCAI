Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Calculation Methodology,,
Reporting Approach,,
Data for our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) indicators is collected and reported on a quarterly basis and is,,
"subject to external assurance for annual reporting (for more information, see",Basis for Preparation,).
Reporting on Total Energy Consumption and data center electricity is based on the data collected for,,
the calculation of our GHG emissions. All numbers are based on the metric system. Whenever we state,,
"“tons,” we mean metric tons.",,
Gross Greenhouse Gas Emissions,,
Definition,,
We define Gross Greenhouse Gas Emissions (location-based) (Gross GHG Emissions (location-,,
based)) as the sum of all GHG emissions measured and reported as Carbon dioxide equivalents,,
"(CO e). We deduct renewable electricity from this amount to determine our Gross GHG Emissions
2",,
"(market-based). For more information, see the Energy Consumption and Mix section.",,
Reporting Principles,,
SAP’s preparation of the GHG emissions data is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting,,
"Standard, the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, and the Corporate Value Chain",,
(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the World Resources Institute/World Business,,
Council for Sustainable Development.,,
"In alignment with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, we report our Gross GHG Emissions using the",,
location-based and market-based calculation methods.,,
Organizational Boundaries,,
SAP defines its organizational boundaries by applying the operational control approach as set out in,,
the GHG Protocol.,,
Operational control is established when SAP has the full authority to introduce and implement its,,
operating policies. The GHG emissions of all operations over which the Company has operational,,
"control and all owned or leased facilities, colocation data centers, and vehicles that the Company",,
"owns or operates are accounted for in the GHG emissions. They are based either on measurements or,",,
"where no measured data is available, on estimations and extrapolations.",,
"Some of SAP’s leased facilities operate under full-service or multitenant leases. In these cases, SAP",,
does not have access to actual energy consumption information. We include these facilities in our,,
definition of operational control and account for them by estimating their energy consumption.,,
Data Consistency,,
Methodology Changes,,
"We aim to continuously refine the methodology we use to calculate GHG emissions, and to increase",,
"the share of input data that is measured instead of extrapolated. For example, we change the source of",,
"activity data, add new activity types, and reflect changes in emission factors and in the approaches",,
used to calculate GHG emissions. Since we define our methodology to the best of our knowledge and,,
"capabilities, and consider such changes to be improvements, we apply them from the current year",,
"onward, and do not adjust our data retrospectively. We explain the current year’s methodology",,
"changes in this section, particularly under Methodology and Further Details.",,
