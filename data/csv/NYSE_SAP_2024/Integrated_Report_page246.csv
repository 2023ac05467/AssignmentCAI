Software license revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time depending on whether we
"deliver standard software, customer-specific software, or software subscription contracts that combine"
"the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, unspecified software products:"
– Licenses for our standard on-premise software products are typically delivered by providing the
customer with access to download the software. We recognize revenue for these on-premise
licenses at the point in time when we grant the license rights to the customer and the customer has
access to and thus control over the software. In judging whether our on-premise software offerings
"grant customers a right to use, rather than a right to access, our intellectual property, we have"
considered the usefulness of our software without subsequent updates to it.
"– Typically, our customer-specific on-premise software development agreements:"
▪ Represent software developed for specific needs of individual customers and therefore do not
have any use for us
▪ Provide us with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date
"For such development agreements, we recognize revenue over time as the software development"
progresses. Judgment is required in identifying an appropriate method to measure the progress
toward complete satisfaction of such performance obligations. We typically measure progress of
our development agreements based on the direct costs incurred to date in developing the software
as a percentage of the total reasonably estimated direct costs to fully complete the development
work (input-based percentage-of-completion method). This method of measuring progress faithfully
"depicts the transfer of the development services to the customer, as substantially all of these costs"
are cost of the staff or third parties performing the development work. In estimating the total cost to
"fully complete the development work, we consider our history with similar projects."
"– For agreements that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future,"
"unspecific software products, we recognize revenue at a point in time for licenses that are made"
immediately accessible to the customer. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the
"software subscription contract for the unspecified software products, as our performance obligation"
is to stand ready to deliver such products on a when-and-if-available basis.
Software support revenue is typically recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the
"term of the support arrangement. Under our standardized support services, our performance"
"obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support and unspecified updates, upgrades,"
and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. Our customers simultaneously receive and
consume the benefits of these support services as we perform.
Service revenue is typically recognized over time. Where we stand ready to provide the service (such
"as access to learning content), we recognize revenue based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the"
service period. Consumption-based services (such as separately identifiable consulting services and
premium support services and classroom training services) are recognized over time as the services
"are utilized, typically following the percentage-of-completion method or ratably. We apply judgment in"
determining whether a service qualifies as a stand-ready service or as a consumption-based service.
Revenue for combined performance obligations is recognized over the longest period of all promises
in the combined performance obligation.
Judgment is also required in determining whether revenue is to be recognized at a point in time or
"over time. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we need to measure progress using the"
method that best reflects SAP’s performance. When using cost incurred as a measure of progress for
"recognizing revenue over time, we apply judgment in estimating the total cost to satisfy the"
performance obligation.
All of the judgments and estimates mentioned above can significantly impact the timing and amount of
revenue to be recognized.
Contract Balances
We recognize trade receivables for performance obligations satisfied over time gradually as the
performance obligation is satisfied and in full once the invoice is due. Judgment is required in
determining whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable.
