Conversion Factors
The calculation of the GHG emissions is based on factors for conversion and extrapolation provided
"by the International Energy Agency (IEA), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), UK Department"
"for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Environment Canada, and the GHG Protocol, as"
internationally recognized authorities. We also use extrapolation factors based on our own reported
"data (from previous quarters) to determine an average consumption value per base unit (for example,"
"liters of fuel per car for fleet vehicles, and electricity consumption per m2 for facilities)."
"Where relevant, our conversion factors consider CO e for greenhouse gases. Global warming potential
2"
factors are based on the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
"(IPCC). We report all our GHG emissions in CO equivalents, including the impact from CH and N O, in

"our target-relevant Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 (GHG Emissions Scope 1), Greenhouse Gas"
"Emissions Scope 2 (location-based) (GHG Emissions (located-based)), Greenhouse Gas Emissions"
"Scope 2 (market-based) (GHG Emissions (market-based)), Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 3"
Upstream (GHG Emissions Scope 3 Upstream) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 3 Downstream
(GHG Emissions Scope 3 Downstream). The emission impact of refrigerants includes
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) only. We review all our emissions and extrapolation factors annually and
"update them if required. In the current reporting year, sulfur hexafluoride (SF ), perfluorocarbons (PFC),

"and nitrogen trifluoride (NF ) emissions are not included in our disclosure, as these gases do not occur

Methodology and Further Details
GHG Emissions Scope 1
Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions and is defined as emissions from sources that are owned or
"controlled by the organization. At SAP, the following areas are covered by Scope 1:"
- Stationary combustion in facilities: GHG emissions caused by oil or gas combustion of heating
systems and generators in SAP office buildings and data centers. GHG emissions are calculated
"based on gas and oil consumption in kilowatt hours (kWh). Where no measured data is available,"
stable values (kWh/m2) based on the previous year’s stationary combustion consumption data
"are used for extrapolation. Where no specific information is available, the natural gas reported by"
local sites is assumed to be at the lower heating value.
- Refrigerants in facilities: HFC emissions caused by the loss of refrigerants used in cooling
systems and air conditioning equipment. The emissions are extrapolated based on the number of
server units in data centers1 and on office space with an air conditioning (A/C) system. All
refrigerants are assumed to be HFC134a.
- Mobile combustion from corporate cars: GHG emissions from the combustion of fuel by
"company cars. In the context of GHG reporting, the term “company car” refers to all cars for which"
SAP permanently covers the fuel costs. GHG emissions are calculated based on fuel
"consumption. If detailed fuel data is not available in specific countries, stable values (liters/car)"
are used for extrapolation based on the number of company cars reported. The stable values for
extrapolation are based on the previous year’s data.
- Mobile combustion from corporate jets: GHG emissions caused by business trips with SAP-
owned or chartered jets. GHG emissions are calculated for SAP’s jets based on actual fuel
consumption.
"- Wood pellets: In addition to gas and oil, we use wood pellets to generate thermal heat for our"
buildings at our headquarters in Walldorf. The GHG emissions from wood pellets for Scope 1 can
"essentially be neutralized, given that the carbon absorption during the tree’s growth phase"
"matches the carbon released during combustion. However, to account for all GHG emissions, we"
include the direct carbon dioxide impact from wood pellet combustion as “outside of scope”
"GHG emissions. In 2024, this fuel accounted for 0.4 kilotons of GHG emissions, compared to 0.3"
kilotons in 2023. The carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the combustion of wood pellets are
categorized as biogenic because the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by the biomass
