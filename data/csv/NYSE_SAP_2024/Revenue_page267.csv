Segment Reporting Policies
Our management reporting system produces reports that present information about our business
"activities in a variety of ways - for example, by line of business, geography, and areas of responsibility of"
"individual Board members. Based on these reports, the Executive Board, which is responsible for"
assessing the performance of our Company and for making resource allocation decisions as our Chief
"Operating Decision Maker (CODM), evaluates business activities based on several different results."
"However, operating results of SAP are reviewed on a Group level by the CODM as a whole."
"There are no parts of our Company that qualify as separate operating segments, and our Executive"
Board assesses the financial performance of our Company on a consolidated basis.
Our management reporting system produces a variety of reports that differ due to the currency
"exchange rates used in the accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations, where both"
actual and constant currency numbers are reported to and used by our CODM. Reports based on
"actual currencies use the same currency rates that are used in our financial statements, whereas"
reports based on constant-currency report revenues and expenses use the average exchange rates
from the previous year’s corresponding period.
We use an operating profit indicator to measure the performance of our operating segments. The
accounting policies applied in the measurement of operating segment expenses and profit differ as
follows from the IFRS accounting principles used to determine the operating profit measure in our
income statements:
The expense measures exclude:
– Acquisition-related charges such as amortization expense and impairment charges for intangibles
"acquired in business combinations, including goodwill impairment charges, and certain standalone"
acquisitions of intellectual property (including purchased in-process research and development)
as well as settlements of pre-existing business relationships in connection with a business
"combination, and acquisition-related third-party expenses"
– Restructuring expenses
– Regulatory compliance matter expenses
Information about assets and liabilities is not regularly provided to our CODM.
