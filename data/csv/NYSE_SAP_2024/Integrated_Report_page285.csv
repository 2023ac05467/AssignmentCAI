"Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates"
"As we do not designate financial assets as “at fair value through profit or loss,” we generally classify"
"financial assets into the following categories: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other"
"comprehensive income (FVOCI), and at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the"
contractual cash flows of and our business model for holding the respective asset.
"For equity securities, as the cash flow characteristics are other than solely principal and interest, we"
take an investment-by-investment decision whether to classify as FVTPL or FVOCI.
The valuation of equity securities of private companies requires judgment because it is typically based
"on significant unobservable inputs, as no market prices are available and there is inherent lack of"
liquidity.
We take the most recent qualitative and quantitative information aspects into consideration to
determine the fair value estimates of these equity securities.
Considerable judgment and assumptions are involved with regard to the selection of appropriate
"comparable company data, the assessment of cash requirements of the business, the acceptance of"
"the technology or products in the addressable markets, the actual and forecasted performance, the"
"milestone achievements, the adequacy of price points from financing rounds, the transaction of similar"
"securities of the same company, the rights and preferences of the underlying securities, the selection"
"of adequate equity allocation parameters, the possible exit scenarios and associated weightings."
"Because all of these assumptions could change significantly, and because valuation is inherently"
"uncertain, our estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used"
"had market prices for the investments existed and that will ultimately be realized, and those"
differences could be material.
"Gains/losses on equity securities at FVTPL include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations, from"
"disposals as well as dividends, while gains/losses on equity securities at FVOCI only include dividends,"
"all of which are shown in Financial income, net. Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at"
the trade date.
