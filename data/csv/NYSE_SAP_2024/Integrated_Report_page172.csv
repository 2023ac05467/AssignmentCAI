Methodologies and Definitions
SAP’s assessment of potential negative human rights impacts (“risks”) is informed by the UNGPs and
the German Supply Chain Act specifically. Our Human Rights Due Diligence program assesses and
"prioritizes the material matters concerning our own employees and value chain workers, such as"
"adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality, equal pay for work of equal value, measures"
"against violence and harassment, and eradication of child and forced labor."
We use ESG risk management software to ensure we have a structured process for assessing potential
"impacts of our own operations and those of our tier 1 suppliers. For information about our suppliers,"
see the Workers in the Value Chain section. Our risk assessment process includes the following steps:
Step 1: Performing an abstract risk analysis in which we evaluate country-specific and industry-specific
risks related to human rights and environmental standards by referencing quantitative indicators from
the World Bank and the United Nations and qualitative data from sources such as the CSR Risk Check
of the German Helpdesk on Business and Human Rights.
Step 2: Performing a concrete risk analysis in which we identify risks from our own operations and from
"our tier 1 suppliers. For our own operations, we examine high-risk topic clusters more closely by"
"interviewing experts, drawing on internal data from, for example, our complaints mechanisms and"
"environmental management system, and on queries from the country-specific financial risk"
identification process.
"Regarding our tier 1 suppliers, we conduct detailed assessments of high-risk suppliers, particularly"
"those with significant spend (that is, of more than €50,000) by using questionnaires to gather"
information about their response to the risks that were identified.
Step 3: Prioritizing potential negative impacts related to our own operations and value chain based on
"criteria such as the nature of our business activities, our ability to influence suppliers, probability and"
"severity (scale, scope, remediability) of potential violations, and the nature of our causal contribution."
