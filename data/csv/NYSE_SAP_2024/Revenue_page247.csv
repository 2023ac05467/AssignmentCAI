Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due or payments received in advance of revenue
recognition.
"Typically, we invoice fees for on-premise standard software on contract closure and software delivery."
"Periodic fixed fees for cloud subscription services, software support services, and other multi-period"
agreements are typically invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance. Such fee prepayments account for
the majority of our contract liability balance. Fees based on actual transaction volumes for cloud
subscriptions and fees charged for non-periodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered.
"While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type and region, our terms typically require"
payment within 30 to 60 days.
