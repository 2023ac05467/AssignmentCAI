Changes to the assumptions underlying our goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments
could require material adjustments to the carrying amount of our recognized goodwill and intangible
assets as well as the amounts of impairment charges recognized in profit or loss.
Changes in our segment structure result in the reallocation of goodwill with the reallocated goodwill
being calculated based on relative values (if a direct allocation is not possible).
