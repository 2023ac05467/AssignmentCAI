"Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates"
"Under IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an"
"identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, SAP recognizes a right-"
of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and
interest expense is recognized on the lease liabilities. The vast majority of our leases consist of facility
and data center leases. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease
term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.
