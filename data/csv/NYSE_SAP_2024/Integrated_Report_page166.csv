Additionality/Carbon,,,,Projects and benefits must be additional. Assumptions about the baseline must reflect reality as,
,,,,closely as possible and avoid overstatements. Deforestation must not have occurred to implement,
,,,,"planting projects. The risk of leakage at the site must be identified, addressed, and reduced.",
Biodiversity,,,,Projects must safeguard and ideally improve biodiversity. The project type and intervention must be,
,,,,"suitable for the native ecosystem. For forestry projects, a selection of diverse, non-invasive, ideally",
,,,,native and climate-resilient trees are to be grown in mixed stands.,
,Community and,,,"Projects must be designed to protect human rights and land rights, enable benefit-sharing, and",
,Benefit-Sharing,,,ensure impacted stakeholders are consulted and involved prior to and during implementation.,
Competence,Competence,,,Partners must have a history of successfully implementing projects and have the necessary,
,,,,expertise to implement the right projects in the right places. Scientific partnerships and project,
,,,,designs are strongly preferred.,
Compliance,,,,Partners must pass SAPâ€™s standard compliance checks. Projects must quantify carbon benefits,
,,,,based on a standardized and externally validated methodology. Carbon credits must be,
,,,,independently certified and validated by an external party. The same carbon impact must not be,
,,,,sold to multiple parties.,
Durability,,,,"Projects must implement measures to address emission sources, and protect the project during the",
,,,,"committed time, ideally permanently. For forestry projects: If necessary to safeguard project",
,,,,"durability, trees are to be selectively and responsibly harvested to allow for regrowth (no large-",
,,,,scale clear-cuts).,
,Transparency,,,Project implementors are to monitor and report on project progress on a regular basis.,
