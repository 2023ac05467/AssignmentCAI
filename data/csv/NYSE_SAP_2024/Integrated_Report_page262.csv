Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The discount rates used in measuring our post-employment benefit assets and liabilities are derived
from rates available on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds for which the timing and
amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension payments. Net
interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized as employee
benefits expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities
that the employees owning the awards perform. Since our domestic defined benefit pension plans
primarily consist of an employee-financed post-retirement plan that is fully financed with qualifying
"insurance policies, current service cost may become a credit as a result of adjusting the defined"
benefit liabilityâ€™s carrying amount to the fair value of the qualifying plan assets. Such adjustments are
recorded in service cost. Total expenses on defined benefit pension plans comprise related current
and past service costs as well as interest income and expense.
