Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Classes of Revenue
"We derive our revenue from fees charged to our customers for the use of our cloud offerings, for"
"licenses to our on-premise software products, and for standardized and premium support services,"
"consulting, customer-specific software developments, training, and other services."
"Cloud and software revenue, as presented in our Consolidated Income Statements, is the sum of our"
"cloud revenue, our software license revenue, and our software support revenue."
Cloud revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with any of the following:
"Software as a service (SaaS), that is, a right to use software functionality (including standard"
functionalities and custom cloud applications and extensions) in a cloud-based infrastructure hosted
"by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP, where the customer does not have the right to terminate the"
hosting contract and take possession of the software to either run it on its own IT infrastructure or to
engage a third-party provider unrelated to SAP to host and manage the software; SaaS also includes
transaction and agent fees for transactions that customers execute on our cloud-based transaction
platforms.
"Platform as a service (PaaS), that is, access to a cloud-based platform to develop, deploy, integrate,"
and manage applications.
"Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), that is, hosting and related application management services for"
software hosted by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP.
"Premium cloud support, that is, support beyond the regular support embedded in the underlying"
cloud subscription services.
Software license revenue represents fees earned from the sale or license of software to customers
"for use on the premises owned or fully controlled by the customer, in other words, where the customer"
has the right to take possession of the software for installation on the customerâ€™s premises or on
hardware of third-party hosting providers unrelated to SAP (on-premise software). Software license
revenue includes revenue from both the sale of our standard software products and customer-specific
on-premise-software development agreements.
Software support revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with standardized
"support services that comprise unspecified future software updates, upgrades, and enhancements as"
well as technical product support services for on-premise software products.
"Services revenue primarily represents fees earned from professional consulting services, premium"
"support services, and training services."
Identification of a Contract
"We frequently enter into multiple contracts with the same customer. For accounting purposes, we treat"
these contracts as a single contract if they are entered into at or near the same time and are
economically interrelated. We do not combine contracts with closing days more than three months
apart because we do not consider them being entered into near the same time. Judgment is required
"in evaluating whether various contracts are interrelated, which includes considerations as to whether"
"they were negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the amount of"
