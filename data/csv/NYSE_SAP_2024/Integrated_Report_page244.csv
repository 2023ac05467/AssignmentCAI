"consideration on one contract is dependent on the performance of the other contract, or if some or all",,
goods in the contracts are a single performance obligation.,,
New arrangements with existing customers can be either a new contract or the modification of prior,,
contracts with the customer. Our judgment in making this determination considers whether there is a,,
"connection between the new arrangement and the pre-existing contracts, whether the goods and",,
services under the new arrangement are highly interrelated with the goods and services sold under,,
"prior contracts, and how the goods and services under the new arrangement are priced. In determining",,
whether a change in transaction price represents a contract modification or a change in variable,,
"consideration, we examine whether the change in price results from changing the contract or from",,
applying unchanged existing contract provisions.,,
Identification of Performance Obligations,,
"Our customer contracts often include various products and services. Typically, the products and",,
services outlined in the,Classes of Revenue,section qualify as separate performance obligations and
"the portion of the contractual fee allocated to them is recognized separately. Judgment is required,",,
"however, in determining whether a good or service is considered a separate performance obligation.",,
"For our professional services and implementation activities, judgment is required to evaluate whether",,
"such services significantly integrate, customize, or modify the on-premise software or cloud service to",,
"which they relate. In this context, we consider the nature of the services and their volume relative to",,
"the volume of the on-premise software or cloud service to which they relate. In general, the",,
implementation services for our cloud services go beyond pure setup activities and qualify as,,
"separate performance obligations. Similarly, our on-premise implementation services and our custom",,
development services typically qualify as separate performance obligations. Non-distinct goods and,,
services are combined into one distinct bundle of goods and services (combined performance,,
obligation).,,
"When selling goods or services, we frequently grant customers options to acquire additional goods or",,
"services (for example, renewals of cloud or support arrangements, or additional volumes of purchased",,
cloud solutions or software). We apply judgment in determining whether such options provide a,,
material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into that contract.,,
"In this judgment, we consider, for example, whether the options entitle the customer to a discount that",,
exceeds the discount granted for the respective goods or services sold together with the option.,,
In scenarios where SAP,,
– Sells indirectly to end customers via partners,,
– Sells third-party products to end customers,,
"– Provides services to end customers with the support of suppliers,",,
SAP determines the respective nature of the performance obligation and whether SAP is providing the,,
specified good or service itself or arranging for the good or service to be provided by the third party.,,
SAP identifies whether it (or the partner) is acting as principal or agent in line with this performance,,
"obligation assessment. SAP exercises judgment in making this assessment, which is based on the",,
question of whether the intermediary controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to,,
"the customer. In exercising this judgment, SAP relies in the majority of cases on the legal responsibility",,
towards the customer in providing the specified good or service and on its pricing discretion for that,,
good or service.,,
Determination of Transaction Price,,
We apply judgment in determining the amount to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for,,
"transferring promised goods or services to a customer. Generally, variable consideration is estimated",,
based on the most likely amount and is included in the transaction price to the extent that the,,
constraint does not apply. This includes estimates as to whether and to what extent subsequent,,
concessions may be granted to customers and whether the customer is expected to pay the,,
"contractual fees. In this judgment, we consider our history with the respective customer or on a",,
portfolio basis.,,
The recognition constraint is applied to on-premise software transactions that include usage-based or,,
"sales-based contingent fees. In contrast, our typical cloud services do not provide the customer with a",,
