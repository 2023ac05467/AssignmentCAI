"For this purpose, we follow the impact measurement and valuation approach. This approach refers to"
"the process of first measuring the physical impact, typically by way of ESG indicators, and then using"
impact valuation factors to convert these indicators into monetary values. Attributing a monetary value
to ESG indicators makes it easier to compare sustainability and financial metrics. It also allows material
"sustainability topics to be incorporated into financial accounting systems and, as a result, enables"
meaningful sustainability management in line with financial indicators.
"SAP applies widely used, state-of-the-art science-based valuation factors to integrate non-financial,"
"monetary performance indicators that companies, investors, and other stakeholders can use for"
"comparison. Methods continue to mature year over year, and various challenges still need to be"
addressed.
