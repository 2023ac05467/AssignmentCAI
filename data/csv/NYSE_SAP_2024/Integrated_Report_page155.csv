"reporting year to eliminate this effect in our 2024 reporting. In our view, this approach reflects a"
"more accurate picture of the actual GHG emissions. In a next step, we determine an average"
"emission factor per euro spent based on short-, medium-, and long-haul flight emission factors."
"For the CO e calculation, this factor is applied to actual costs for business flights. Emission factors
2"
for business flights do not consider the radiative forcing factors (77% data coverage).
- Rental cars: GHG emissions caused by business trips by rental car. An average emission factor
from rental cars is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs incurred. This
average emission factor is used for extrapolation based on the costs (75% data coverage).
- Train travel: GHG emissions from business trips by train. An average emission factor from train
travel is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs incurred. This average
"factor is used for extrapolation based on costs. In Germany, business trips by train are considered"
"carbon neutral, as they are compensated by 100% green electricity by Deutsche Bahn (39% data"
coverage).
- Business trips by private car: GHG emissions from business trips by employee-owned cars and
company cars without fuel cards. These GHG emissions are calculated based on the distance
traveled by private car. This activity type does not include trips by company cars with fuel cards
(100% data coverage).
- Flexible Mobility: We are also calculating GHG emissions from our Flexible Mobility program.
Employees taking part in this program receive a monthly mobility budget that they can spend on
"various means of transportation, such as public transportation, rental cars, and rental bikes. The"
"CO e resulting from this program is calculated using a spend-based method similar to that
2"
described in the Purchased Goods and Services section (100% data coverage).
- Employee commuting: GHG emissions caused by commuting between home and work at an
"SAP office location, considering all modes of transportation, and excluding commutes by"
"company car. To collect the data, we conduct an SAP-global, Qualtrics-based commuting survey"
about the distance to work and the mode of transportation used. The last survey was conducted
"in 2022, and we received approximately 30,000 valid responses, which are the basis for our GHG"
calculation of employee commuting in 2024. Commuting data for non-responding employees and
"for quarterly updates is extrapolated based on the number of FTEs, excluding those employees"
who drive a company car (28% data coverage).
- Purchased goods and services: This category includes all significant cradle-to-gate upstream
emissions from goods and services that SAP purchased during the reporting period. We also
"include services from waste and water disposal in this category. In addition, it contains the"
"services from our hyperscale providers, fuel- and energy-related activities, and upstream"
transportation and distribution. SAP includes all significant cradle-to-gate emissions for its net-
"zero 2030 target. Therefore, we apply a different calculation method for all purchased goods and"
"services. To derive the CO e values, SAP closely collaborates with a third-party provider that
2"
utilizes a spend-based method. We use coefficients that translate each US$ of spend into
"kilograms of CO e. The coefficients are available for each country-sector combination and by
2"
"supply chain tier (direct suppliers, suppliers of suppliers, and so on) (100% data coverage)."
"- Capital goods: Includes all cradle-to-gate upstream emissions of purchased capital goods, such"
"as buildings, data center and IT equipment, and cars (100% data coverage)."
GHG Emissions Scope 3 Downstream
- Use of sold products: A major part of our overall GHG emissions stems from the use of our
software (customers running SAP solutions on their hardware and premises). The estimated
energy consumption is extrapolated globally based on the number of productive installations and
"average regional PUEs at year-end, derived from SAPâ€™s managed colocations. For systems without"
"maintenance contracts, SAP has no transparency on whether the solutions are still in use."
"Therefore, we only consider on-premise solutions with active maintenance contracts. This way, we"
"ensure that only active, still functional software products are included in the calculation (100%"
data coverage).
GHG emissions are calculated using a global electricity emission factor. The calculation covers all our
"major solutions, including on-premise software. Cloud solutions are not included, as they are part of"
