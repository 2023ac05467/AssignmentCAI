Internal Expert
"The materiality of the IROs we identified was assessed by internal experts from, for example, our Total"
Rewards and Data Center Management teams. We assigned the IROs related to a specific topic to the
"respective team or teams for assessment. While we selected these experts carefully, due to the nature"
"of the materiality assessment their judgment determines its outcome. Consequently, the results of our"
materiality assessment are influenced by our choice of experts.
Impact Valuation Approach
We use the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) methodology to measure and value the impact that SAPâ€™s
business activities have on society and the environment.
