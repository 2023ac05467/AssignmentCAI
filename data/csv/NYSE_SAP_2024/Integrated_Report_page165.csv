Share of credits from carbon retailers,
SAP collaborates with an independent third-party carbon rating agency to systematically procure,
carbon credits from carbon retailers which are exclusively generated by the highest-rated carbon,
"projects on the market based on the projects’ carbon score, additionality, durability, and co-benefits",
such as the positive impact on people and biodiversity. This diligent procurement approach helps SAP,
to mitigate the risk of procuring non-genuine carbon emission reductions while reinforcing our own,
quality expectations.,
