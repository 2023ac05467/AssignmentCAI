for Supervisory Board Members","Non-financial KPIs are the following performance measures, which are important",
,"in terms of SAP’s long-term, sustainable performance: the Customer Net",
,"Promoter score, which measures the satisfaction of SAP customers; the",
,"Employee Engagement Index, which reflects employees’ commitment, their pride",
,"in the Company and their loyalty; and CO2 performance, which tracks SAP’s",
,greenhouse gas emissions.,
,,
,A target is set for each non-financial key performance indicator (KPI). These,
,targets are defined based on SAP’s long-term strategic planning and taking into,
,account the full-year values achieved. Based on the target value required for,
,"100% target achievement, target achievement curves are also defined for the",
,non-financial KPIs. These specify a cap if target achievement reaches 140%. The,
,relevant period is the fiscal year for which the STI is being awarded. The non-,
,"financial KPIs have a total weighting of 20%, within which the respective",
,weightings of the individual non-financial KPIs may vary.,
,,
,The payout under the STI (short-term incentive) is determined based on several,
,financial and non-financial KPIs. The STI is awarded in the form of a weighted,
,target amount specified in the Executive Board member’s service contract that is,
,paid out if the total of the weighted target achievement for financial and non-,
,financial KPIs (total target achievement) is 100%.,
