Measuring Non-Controlling Interests and Allocation of Consideration
Transferred
We decide for each business combination whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the
acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
We classify costs related to executing business combinations as general and administration expense.
"In our accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in determining whether an"
intangible asset is identifiable and whether it should be recorded separately from goodwill.
"Additionally, estimating the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities"
assumed involves considerable judgment. The necessary measurements are based on information
available on the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been
"deemed reasonable by management. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially"
"affect our financial position and profit for several reasons, including the following:"
– Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and amortization affect the amounts of
depreciation and amortization to be recorded in operating profit in the periods following the
acquisition.
– Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of assets may result in additional
expense from impairment charges.
– Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities and provisions may result in additional
expense (if increasing the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing the estimated fair
value).
