software license because the customer does not have the right to terminate the hosting contract and
"take possession of the software. Consequently, variable cloud fees are considered in the transaction"
"price based on estimates, rather than being accounted for as usage-based or sales-based license"
"royalties. If SAP pays consideration to a customer in exchange for a distinct good or service, and such"
"purchase is linked to a customer contract, an estimate of fair value of such goods and services is"
required to conclude whether or not to account for a reduction in the transaction price of the linked
customer contract.
Only very rarely do our contracts include significant financing components. We do not account for
financing components if the period between when SAP transfers the promised goods or services to
the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services is one year or less.
Allocation of Transaction Price
We have established a hierarchy to identify the standalone selling prices (SSPs) that we use to allocate
the transaction price of a customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract.
"– Where the SSPs for an offering are observable and reasonably consistent across customers (that is,"
"not highly variable), our SSP estimates are derived from our respective pricing history. Typically, our"
standardized support offerings and our professional service offerings follow this approach.
"– Where sales prices for an offering are not directly observable or highly variable across customers,"
we use estimation techniques.
"Effective 2024, we applied a new technique to estimate the SSP of our cloud offerings, using input"
parameters that more appropriately reflect SAP’s matured commercial models and observed pricing
"practices in the cloud. This SSP considers overall pricing objectives, taking market conditions and other"
factors into account. We estimate the SSP using a specific pricing range that encompasses the majority
of our transactions.
SAP estimates the impact of this change in estimation technique for our cloud offerings on the
allocation of transaction prices to performance obligations within customer contracts to be immaterial
for the current period.
"– As SAP’s go-to-market strategies evolve further, SAP continuously monitors its commercial models"
"and pricing practices, which could result in changes to our SSPs in the future. For offerings for which"
"we cannot justify a range and we observe highly variable pricing, and for which we lack substantial"
"direct costs to estimate based on a cost-plus-margin approach, we allocate the transaction price by"
applying a residual approach. We use this technique in particular for our standard on-premise
software offerings.
Judgment is required when estimating SSPs. To judge whether the historical pricing of our goods and
"services is highly variable, we have established thresholds of pricing variability."
"When we estimate an SSP range based on pricing objectives, we use judgment in determining the"
upper and lower end of the range. Such judgment considers price points achieved in the market as
well as strategic pricing decisions.
The SSPs of material right options depend on the probability of option exercise. In estimating these
"probabilities, we apply judgment considering historical exercise patterns."
– Recognition of Revenue
Cloud revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For cloud business models
"where we grant rights to continuously access and use one or more cloud offerings for a certain term,"
revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over this term. For cloud business
models provisioned on a consumption basis where a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on
"cloud services throughout the contract term, but with the discretion to call off cloud services during"
"the contract term, we recognize revenue based on consumption as it best reflects our measure"
towards satisfaction of that performance obligation. In limited scenarios where the transaction price is
"entirely variable and determined by the customer’s consumption, we recognize revenue based on"
usage in the period in which it was earned.
