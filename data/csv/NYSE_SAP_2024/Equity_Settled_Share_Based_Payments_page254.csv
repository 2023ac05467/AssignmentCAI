Statements according to the activities that the receiving employees perform. Accelerated share-based
payment expenses triggered by SAP’s restructuring program are classified as restructuring expenses in
our Consolidated Income Statements and included in the restructuring provisions in our Statements of
"Financial Position. For more information about SAP’s transformation program, see Note (B.6)."
"Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty"
"We use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including"
"expected share price volatility and expected dividend yields. In addition, the final number of"
Performance Share Units (PSUs) vesting also depends on the achievement of performance indicators.
"Furthermore, the payout for cash-settled share units depends on our share price on the respective"
vesting dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could
require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these
share-based payments. The fair value of the share units granted under the SAP Long-Term Incentive
Program 2024 and 2020 (LTI 2024 and LTI 2020) is dependent on our performance against the total
"shareholder return (TSR) for NASDAQ-100 companies, the volatility, and the expected correlation"
between the TSR of the NASDAQ-100 companies and our TSR.
"Regarding future payout under our cash-settled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor."
"With respect to our LTI 2024 and LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted"
not only by our share price but also by the relative TSR performance against the NASDAQ-100
companies. Future payouts under our LTI 2024 and LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-
"market-based performance conditions based on SAP’s long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not"
incorporated into our fair value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted.
Changes in these factors could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the
"valuation model, and the future payout."
"Under the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we grant our employees discounts on share purchases. As"
"those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount"
is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted.
Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows
We present the payments of our cash-settled share-based payment plans and our equity-settled
share-based payment plans that are fulfilled by share purchases at the market separately in our
"Statements of Cash Flows under Cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the changes in Other"
assets and in Other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow do not consider
share-based payment-related assets or liabilities. Payments of cash-settled share-based payments
triggered by SAP’s restructuring program are included in the restructuring payments.
