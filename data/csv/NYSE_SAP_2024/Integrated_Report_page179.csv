"Employee Engagement Index (EEI): For more information, see the Incorporation by Reference"
section of our Appendix .
Leadership Trust Net Promoter Score (Leadership Trust NPS): The metric is derived from a
question in our #Unfiltered survey that gauges employees’ trust in our leaders. Based on the Customer
"NPS methodology, it is calculated as a percentage of “promoters” (a score of 9 or 10 on a 10-point"
scale) minus the percentage of “detractors” (a score of 1 through 6). The method ignores “passives” (a
"score of 7 or 8). Consequently, the value range of the NPS is –100 to +100, with the latter being the"
best achievable score.
Business Health Culture Index (BHCI): This metric was collected in the #Unfiltered survey run in
"June 2024. For more information, see the Health, Safety, and Well-Being section."
Simplification of Processes: This index shows the impact of our continued efforts to simplify our
processes. It is measured on the basis of answers to 14 questions in our #Unfiltered program
(November 2024 survey).
Diversity & Inclusion Index: The Diversity & Inclusion Score from #Unfiltered indicates the extent to
which SAP successfully offers employees a working environment that promotes diversity and inclusion.
The index is measured on the basis of answers to three questions (June 2024 survey).
