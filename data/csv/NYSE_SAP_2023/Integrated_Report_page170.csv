products and services that we have delivered to them. The obligations arising from customer-related
litigation and claims comprise cases in which we indemnify our customers against liabilities arising
"from a claim that our products infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, or other"
proprietary rights.
"Due to uncertainties relating to these matters, provisions are based on the best information available."
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether and when a provision is to be
"recorded and what the appropriate amount for such provision should be. Notably, judgment is"
required in the following areas:
– Determining whether an obligation exists
– Determining the probability of outflow of economic benefits
– Determining whether the amount of an obligation is reliably estimable
– Estimating the amount of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation
"At the end of each reporting period, we reassess the potential obligations related to our pending"
claims and litigation and adjust our respective provisions to reflect the current best estimate. In
"addition, we monitor and evaluate new information that we receive after the end of the respective"
"reporting period, but before the Consolidated Financial Statements are authorized for issue, to"
determine whether this provides additional information regarding conditions that existed at the end of
the reporting period. Changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our accounting for legal
"contingencies, and outcomes that differ from these estimates and assumptions, could require material"
adjustments to the carrying amounts of the respective provisions recorded and additional provisions.
The expected timing or amounts of any outflows of economic benefits resulting from these lawsuits
"and claims are uncertain and not estimable, as they generally depend on the duration of the legal"
proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve the litigation and claims and the
unpredictability of the outcomes of legal disputes in several jurisdictions.
