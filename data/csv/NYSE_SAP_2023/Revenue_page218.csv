"non-operating income/expense, net in the same period when the foreign operation is partially"
disposed of or sold.
c) Fair Value Hedge
We apply fair value hedge accounting for certain of our fixed-rate financial liabilities and show the fair
"value fluctuations in Financial income, net."
d) Valuation and Testing of Effectiveness
"At inception of a designated hedging relationship, we document our risk management strategy and the"
economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic
relationship is demonstrated as well as the effectiveness of the hedging relationship tested
"prospectively by applying the critical terms match for our foreign currency hedges, since currencies,"
"maturities, and the amounts are closely aligned for the forecasted transactions and for the spot"
"element of the forward exchange rate contract or intrinsic value of the currency options, respectively."
"For interest rate swaps, effectiveness is tested prospectively using statistical methods in the form of a"
"regression analysis, by which the validity and extent of the relationship between the change in value of"
the hedged items as the independent variable and the fair value change of the derivatives as the
dependent variable is determined. The main sources of ineffectiveness are:
– The effect of the counterparty and our own credit risk on the fair value of the forward exchange
"contracts and interest rate swaps, which is not reflected in the respective hedged item, and"
– Differences in the timing of hedged item and hedged transaction in our cash flow hedges.
