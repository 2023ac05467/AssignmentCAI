"By applying this judgment, we record an allowance for a specific customer when it is probable that a"
credit loss has occurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Basing the expected
credit loss allowance for the remaining receivables primarily on our historical loss experience likewise
"requires judgment, as history may not be indicative of future development. Also, including reasonable"
and supportable forward-looking information in the loss rates of the expected credit loss allowance
"requires judgment, as they may not provide a reliable prediction for future development."
