– Where standalone selling prices for an offering are observable and reasonably consistent across
"customers (that is, not highly variable), our SSP estimates are derived from our respective pricing"
"history. Typically, our standardized support offerings and our professional service offerings follow"
this approach.
"– Where sales prices for an offering are not directly observable or highly variable across customers,"
we use estimation techniques. For renewable offerings with highly variable pricing across
"customers, these techniques consider the individual contract’s expected renewal price as far as this"
"price is substantive. Typically, our cloud offerings follow this approach. For non-renewable offerings,"
these estimations follow a cost-plus-margin approach.
"– For offerings that lack renewals, have highly variable pricing, and lack substantial direct costs to"
"estimate based on a cost-plus-margin approach, we allocate the transaction price by applying a"
residual approach. We use this technique in particular for our standard on-premise software
offerings.
Judgment is required when estimating SSPs. To judge whether the historical pricing of our goods and
"services is highly variable, we have established thresholds of pricing variability. For judging whether"
"individually negotiated contractual renewal prices are substantive, we have established floor prices"
based on internal calculation which include a minimum margin that we use as SSPs whenever the
contractual renewal prices are below these floor prices. In judging whether contracts are expected to
"renew at their contractual renewal prices, we rely on our respective renewal history. The SSPs of"
"material right options depend on the probability of option exercise. In estimating these probabilities,"
we apply judgment considering historical exercise patterns.
We review the SSPs periodically or whenever facts and circumstances change to ensure the most
objective input parameters available are used.
Recognition of Revenue
Cloud revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For cloud business models
"where we grant rights to continuously access and use one or more cloud offerings for a certain term,"
revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over this term. For cloud business
models provisioned on a consumption basis where a customer commits to a fixed value of spend on
"cloud services throughout the contract term, but with the discretion to call off cloud services during"
"the contract term, we recognize revenue based on consumption as it best reflects our measure"
towards satisfaction of that performance obligation. In limited scenarios where the transaction price is
"entirely variable and determined by the customer’s consumption, we recognize revenue based on"
usage in the period in which it was earned.
Software license revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time depending on whether we
"deliver standard software, customer-specific software, or software subscription contracts that combine"
"the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, unspecified software products:"
– Licenses for our standard on-premise software products are typically delivered by providing the
customer with access to download the software. We recognize revenue for these on-premise
licenses at the point in time when we grant the license rights to the customer and the customer has
access to and thus control over the software. In judging whether our on-premise software offerings
"grant customers a right to use, rather than a right to access, our intellectual property, we have"
considered the usefulness of our software without subsequent updates to it.
"– Typically, our customer-specific on-premise software development agreements:"
▪ Represent software developed for specific needs of individual customers and therefore do not
have any use for us
▪ Provide us with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date
"For such development agreements, we recognize revenue over time as the software development"
progresses. Judgment is required in identifying an appropriate method to measure the progress
toward complete satisfaction of such performance obligations. We typically measure progress of
our development agreements based on the direct costs incurred to date in developing the software
as a percentage of the total reasonably estimated direct costs to fully complete the development
