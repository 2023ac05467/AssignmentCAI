Report Data Hub
"At SAP, we have a multitude of non-headcount-relevant employee"
categories defined. None of these categories match the GRI definition
"of “non-guaranteed hours employees.” However, at SAP we have"
"employees who are paid hourly (for example, working students) but"
who have a reliable minimum number of hours guaranteed. This group
represents about 1.3% of the total SAP workforce.
