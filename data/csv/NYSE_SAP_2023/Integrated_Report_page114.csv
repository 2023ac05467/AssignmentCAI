,,• Efficient power usage effectiveness (PUE)58 at SAP headquarters in Germany and North America: 1.50,
,,"• Core refurbishment of buildings: starting with building WDF01 at SAP’s headquarters in Germany, which aims to save 42% in",
,,final energy used annually compared to the previous construction method.,
,,• Centralization of the cooling distribution system at SAP’s headquarters in Germany will allow the usage of environmentally,
,,friendly operating fluids and sector coupling (conversion of surplus energy into cooling energy by absorption chillers and,
,,use of heat pumps for room cooling). Electricity for the cooling system will be derived primarily from renewable sources,
,,(such as solar).,
"Global car fleet: Transition to
electric or zero-emission vehicles",,"From 2025 onwards, all new company cars for employees are planned to be emission-free.59 At the end of 2023, about",
,,"14% of our global car fleet comprised emission-free vehicles. SAP also promotes various incentives to accelerate this change,",
,,for example:,
,,• We power all SAP-owned charging stations at SAP locations with 100% renewable electricity.,
,,"• For larger vehicle fleets such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and others, we offer employees a subsidy to install a charging",
,,"point at home, and reimburse them for the electricity consumed. As far as legally possible and factually reasonable, we will",
,,offer similar subsidies in all countries.,
,,"• In some countries, we offer our employees a discount or a higher budget if they choose an all-electric vehicle.",
,,"• We continually expand SAP’s global charging infrastructure (2023: 1,650+ charging stations; 2022: 1,100+ charging stations).",
Alternative commuting,,"To generate a shift in commuting habits and foster inter-/multimodal mobility, we continue to offer various programs, such as:",
,,• Company bicycle leasing programs: Employees can lease bicycles with the option of purchasing them after contract end.,
,,"Such programs have already been established in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.",
,,• Successful role out of a flexible mobility budget in spring 2023 as a regular mobility alternative in Germany (2023: about,
,,"1,950 participants). Participants receive a fixed monthly mobility budget to use any mode of transport to commute to work",
,,"or in their leisure time (bicycle, e-scooter, rental car, train, bus, and so on).",
Business flights,"• We avoid business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies.
• In 2016, we began charging an internal carbon price for business flights, which we invest in high-quality carbon offset
projects to counterbalance the carbon emissions these flights cause. By annually increasing the carbon price per flight
ticket that is charged to the organizational cost center, we seek to incentivize the organizational units and employees to fly
less or to choose an alternative, sustainable mode of travel.",• We avoid business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies.,
