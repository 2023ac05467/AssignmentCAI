For the European Economic Area (EA) and
"European Union (EU), we consult with the SAP SE"
Works Council (Europe) on significant organizational
"changes. At the same time, the changes are"
"discussed with the local social partners, including"
"outside the EEA, EU, and United Kingdom (UK)."
There is no fixed lead time between informing
employees and implementing the changes.
"However, in the event of significant changes, SAP"
provides extensive change management measures
to bring employees closer to the justification for the
implementation of the measure and to motivate
them to contribute to the changes.
