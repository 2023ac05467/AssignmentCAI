SAP has developed an internal health and safety
management system called “Run Healthy” which is
built on International Labour Organization
Occupational Health and Safety (ILO-OSH)
standards and SAP's internal Health & Safety Policy.
Run Healthy enables SAP organizations to assess
"their maturity state on health, safety, and well-being"
to develop and drive targeted initiatives across their
organizations and to boost their local Business
"Health Culture Index, employee engagement, and"
employer attractivity. The implementation is
voluntary and driven by the managing director
according to country/line-of-business needs. We
give all workers access to global offerings which are
complemented according to local business needs.
Local Run Healthy councils are key in the process to
self-assess maturity levels in the light of covering
local requirements and global standards. Run
Healthy is expanded on a continuous basis. In
"addition, SAP engages with its suppliers, partners,"
and customers to promote the topics of people
health and occupational safety beyond the
boundaries of our company.

SAP Health & Safety Commitment Statement
Human Rights Commitment Statement
SAP regularly conducts health risk assessments on
global level with reporting on all manager levels.
Mental health is key to SAP’s ability to provide
innovative solutions for our customers. SAP has a
long tradition in taking action against stigmatization
and applying the Employee Care Cycle covering
"prevention, early detection, case management, and"
"re-integration. With the Stress-Satisfaction Score,"
SAP is monitoring an early-watch KPI to measure
resilience on people level and to detect fields of
"action on individual and organizational level. In 2023,"
we conducted a hybrid-work-related risk
assessment to identify health risk factors while
working hybrid. A “Country Health Dashboard”
based on SAP Analytics Cloud supports the
identification of health risks on country level.
SAP relies on the enablement of internal multiplier
"networks such as the Health Ambassador Network,"
and external trainings and certifications to ensure
health and safety competence across the
organization.
Our employees can use various tools to report
"concerns, as outlined in the Human Rights"
"Commitment Statement, and are protected against"
retaliation. This document is core to our people-
"related policies, such as the Global Health and"
"Safety Policy. For more information, see the"
Employees section. Please also refer to GRI 2-8.
