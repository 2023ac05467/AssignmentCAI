Employees: How We Measure and Manage Our
Performance
Employees
"By regularly conducting surveys, we continuously"
receive insights which enable SAP and particularly
"its Global Health, Safety & Well-Being organization,"
together with its strong partners in Human
"Resources, Real Estate and Facilities, Occupational"
Safety and Physical Security to enforce and adjust
its initiatives and counteract adverse developments
in time.
"Our Global Health, Safety & Well-Being team"
provides global frameworks and a comprehensive
"health, safety, and well-being portfolio to enable"
SAP’s business with its organizations at all levels to
run healthy and safe.
Please also refer to GRI 403-6 and GRI 2-8.
SAP’s Health & Safety program “Run Healthy”
includes a self-assessment conducted by a cross-
functional staffed council in order to drive tailor-
made and effective local programs and initiatives.
Digital solutions are leveraged to guide SAP’s
people to their relevant health content by
considering individual needs and location and to
gather their feedback to drive highest standards of
"quality, as we do with the permanent Qualtrics-"
based Health Feedback Survey across all health
and well-being offerings.
A Run Healthy council is the execution entity for the
Run Healthy program (see GRI 403-1 for its purpose
and target). It meets regularly (usually quarterly) and
"contains the Run Healthy lead, different line-of-"
"business representatives, such as from the Human"
"Resources, Real Estate and Facilities, and Health"
"departments, as well as an employee"
representative. The program is being expanded step
by step; not all SAP employees are represented by
the Run Healthy program.
Please also refer to GRI 2-8.
"At SAP, we offer a flexible training and enablement"
portfolio (such as SAP’s learning platform Success
Map) to enable our people to thrive in the future of
"work, foster healthy working habits, and become"
multipliers. In addition to flagship sessions on how
"to manage stress and foster a healthy work lifestyle,"
the “Are you OK?” mental well-being initiative
continued and SAP launched its first Global Health
"Summit to enable stakeholders, people, and leaders"
on the renewed Health & Safety Policy.
