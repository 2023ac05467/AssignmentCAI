Scope 3,,• Covers electricity consumed by hyperscale services.,
,,"• Market-based reporting: To a large proportion, most of SAP’s hyperscaler providers operate their data centers with",
,,"renewable electricity sources. To ensure that SAP’s cloud infrastructure runs with 100% renewable electricity, we procure",
,,EACs for the remaining electricity consumption not already covered by renewable electricity from our providers. For this,
,,"purpose, we use the latest available and assured renewable electricity information of our suppliers: For fiscal year 2023,",
,,"we relied on supplier data from 2022, as externally assured data for 2023 was not yet available at the point of",
,,publication of this Integrated Report.,
,,"• In the location-based net carbon emissions, the renewable electricity by our hyperscalers as well as the SAP-procured",
,,EACs for any remaining non-renewable electricity consumption is deducted from our Scope 3 hyperscaler emissions.,
,,"• For SAP-procured EACs, we also ensure that it is confirmed by an official certificate or written confirmation of our",
,,respective EAC suppliers (100% data coverage).,
