Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
We use derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk or interest rate risk and designate them as cash flow
"or fair value hedges if they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9, which involves judgment."
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments in Hedge Accounting Relationships
"Many transactions constitute economic hedges, and therefore contribute effectively to the securing of"
financial risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. To hedge currency risks inherent in
"foreign-currency denominated and recognized monetary assets and liabilities, we do not designate our"
"held-for-trading derivative financial instruments in hedge accounting, because the profits and losses"
from the underlying transactions are recognized in profit or loss in the same periods as the profits or
losses from the derivatives.
"In addition, we occasionally have contracts that contain foreign currency embedded derivatives that"
are required to be accounted for separately.
Fair value fluctuations in the spot component of such derivatives at FVTPL are included in Other non-
"operating income/expense, net while the forward element is shown in Financial income, net."
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
a) Cash Flow Hedge
"In general, we apply cash flow hedge accounting to the foreign currency risk of highly probable"
"forecasted transactions. With regard to foreign currency risk, hedge accounting relates to the spot price"
and to the intrinsic values of the derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges.
"Accordingly, the effective portion of these components determined on a present value basis is"
recorded in other comprehensive income. The forward element and time value as well as foreign
currency basis spreads excluded from the hedging relationship are recorded as cost of hedging in a
"separate position in other comprehensive income. As the amounts are not material, they are presented"
together with the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in our consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity. All other components
including counterparty credit risk adjustments of the derivative and the ineffective portion are
"immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in other"
"comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other non-operating income/expense, net"
"and Financial income, net in the same period when the hedged item affects profit or loss."
b) Net Investment Hedge
"In general, we do not hedge the foreign currency exposure from the net assets of subsidiaries with a"
"functional currency different from the euro, and we do not apply net investment hedge accounting."
"However, in selected cases we might do so, and we applied net investment hedge accounting in 2023."
"For more information, see Note (D.1)."
The designated component in hedge accounting is the spot price of the derivatives designated and
"qualifying as net investment hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of this component determined"
on a present value basis is recorded in Other comprehensive income. All other not-designated
"components or ineffective portions are immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or"
loss. Amounts accumulated in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other
