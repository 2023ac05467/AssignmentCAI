In alignment with the different legal requirements in,
"various countries, and as per the SAP Global Risk",
"Management Policy and supporting processes, SAP,",
together with legal advisory services as deemed,
"appropriate, perform risk assessments globally.",
These include cross-business topics and the,
"evaluation of risks related to compliance, bribery,",
"and corruption. Overall, our corporate risk",
assessments focus on compliance topics. In,
"addition, 38% of all audits concluded in 2023 under",
the risk-based audit plan are compliance-relevant,
"audits. As part of this process, a regular and",
dedicated focus is also placed on identifying high-,
risk countries so as to identify deep dive reviews,
and necessary mitigations accompanied by regular,
monitoring.,
"Furthermore, ad hoc audits are performed if there",
are grounds of suspicion. This regular auditing is a,
vital component of ensuring compliance worldwide,
in our business processes and identifying,
weaknesses or non-compliance to derive adequate,
measures.,
Given the holistic approach of our compliance risk,
"assessment, SAP does not report on the number of",
audits solely related to corruption.,
SAP’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,
(CoEBC) provides the primary ethical and legal,
framework within which SAP conducts business. It,
also addresses SAP’s policies regarding anti-,
corruption.,
The CoEBC is available internally on the Company’s,
intranet and externally on the Internet. All members,
"of the SAP Executive Board and Supervisory Board,",
"all SAP employees, all SAP partners, suppliers, and",
"shareholders, as well as the general public, have full",
access to the CoEBC.,
We do not collect the data of the geographical,
distribution and the type of our business partners,
who access the CoEBC. For a breakdown of the,
"geographical distribution of all SAP employees, see",
the Report Data Hub.,
The completion rate for mandatory training,
applicable to all SAP employees88 on the subject of,
anti-corruption exceeded 99% in 2023. The,
numbers of employees per region are listed below:,
