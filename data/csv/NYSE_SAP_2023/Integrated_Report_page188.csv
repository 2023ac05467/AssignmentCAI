"The assessment whether a deferred tax asset is impaired requires judgment, as we need to estimate"
future taxable profits to determine whether the utilization of the deferred tax asset is probable. In
"evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative"
"evidence, including the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income"
over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Our judgment regarding future
taxable income is based on assumptions about future market conditions and future profits of SAP.
Judgment is also required in evaluating whether interest or penalties related to income taxes meet the
"definition of income taxes, and, if not, whether it is of financial nature. In this judgment, we particularly"
consider applicable local tax laws and interpretations on IFRS by national standard setters in the area
of group financial reporting.
