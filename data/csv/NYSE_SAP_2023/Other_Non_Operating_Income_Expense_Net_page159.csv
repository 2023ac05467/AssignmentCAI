General Accounting Policies
Bases of Measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the
following:
"– Derivative financial instruments, liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments, and financial"
assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal or interest are measured at fair
value.
– Post-employment benefits are measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligations
less the fair value of the plan assets.
– Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at period-end
exchange rates.
– Provisions are recognized at the best estimate of their fulfillment amount when they occur.
