Nothing has a greater impact on our long-term
"success than the creativity, talent, commitment,"
"health, safety, and well-being of our people. Their"
"ability to collaborate, innovate, and understand the"
needs of our customers has the potential to deliver
"sustainable value to our company, customers, and"
society.
"As an enterprise software company, SAP’s"
occupational health and safety concerns relate to
the knowledge industry and are different to those
encountered in manufacturing industries. Most of
our employees are of academic background and
"have sedentary, intellectually demanding jobs in a"
constantly changing business environment with
"specifically high demands on self-organization,"
"international collaboration, flexibility, agility, and"
adaptability. Key health and safety management
"focus areas at SAP are stress management, self-"
"management, work-life balance support, personal"
"resilience, a psychologically safe work environment,"
"an ergonomically safe office setup, travel medicine,"
"pandemic management, vaccinations, road safety,"
and general medical prevention for all.
Employees
SAP provides manifold feedback opportunities and
encourages its people to get involved and shape
SAP’s caring culture and working conditions by
"“telling it like it is,” and in doing so, help us improve"
where needed. Our success is tracked through the
Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) and the
Stress-Satisfaction Score (measured by regular
"employee surveys), which revealed that job"
satisfaction was equal or higher than the perceived
stress for about 74% of SAP participants in 2023.
SAP Health & Safety Commitment Statement
Conditions in which people live up to their full
potential – now and in the future of work – are
mainly defined by the organization’s leadership style
and working culture. We believe that there can be
no organizational health without individual health.
SAP and its leaders take ownership for workplaces
"and a caring culture that foster physical health,"
"safety, and mental well-being, while every employee"
is enabled and encouraged to take care of their
individual health.
"The Global Health, Safety & Well-Being team (led by"
"SAP’s Chief Medical Officer), together with their"
"partners in Human Resources, Real Estate and"
"Facilities, Occupational Safety and Physical Security,"
"provide the information, education, and support to"
foster a healthy working culture and a supporting
"environment for all people. In doing so, we enable"
"the organization to be a role model in safe, healthy,"
and sustainable people management.
