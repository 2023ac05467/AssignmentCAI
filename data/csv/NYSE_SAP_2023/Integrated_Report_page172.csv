Accounting for Share-Based Payments
Classification in the Income Statement
Share-based payments cover equity-settled and cash-settled awards issued to our employees. The
respective expenses are recognized as employee benefits and classified in our Consolidated Income
Statements according to the activities that the receiving employees perform.
"Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty"
"We use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including"
"expected share price volatility and expected dividend yields. In addition, the final number of"
Performance Share Units (PSUs) vesting also depends on the achievement of performance indicators.
"Furthermore, the payout for cash-settled share units depends on our share price on the respective"
vesting dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could
require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these
share-based payments. The fair value of the share units granted under the SAP Long-Term Incentive
Program 2020 (LTI 2020) is dependent on our performance against the total shareholder return (TSR)
"for NASDAQ-100 companies, the volatility, and the expected correlation between the TSR of the"
NASDAQ-100 companies and our TSR.
"Regarding future payout under our cash-settled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor."
"With respect to our LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by"
our share price but also by the relative TSR performance against the NASDAQ-100 companies. Future
payouts under our LTI 2020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance
"conditions based on SAPâ€™s long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair"
value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity of awards granted. Changes in these factors
"could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future"
payout.
"Under the OWN SAP share purchase plan, we grant our employees discounts on share purchases. As"
"those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount"
is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted.
Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows
We present the payments of our cash-settled share-based payment plans separately in our
"Statements of Cash Flows under Cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the changes in other"
assets and in other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow do not consider
share-based payment-related assets or liabilities.
