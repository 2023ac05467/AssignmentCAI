Accounting for Interests in Subsidiaries
Changes in SAP's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as
"equity transactions. When SAP loses control over the subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and"
"liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of"
equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.
