– Determining the future ability to use or sell the intangible asset arising from the development and
the determination of the probability of future benefits from sale or use
– Determining whether a cost is directly or indirectly attributable to an intangible asset and whether a
cost is necessary for completing a development
These judgments impact the total amount of intangible assets that we present in our balance sheet as
well as the timing of recognizing development expenses in profit or loss.

Measurement of Intangibles
All our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill have finite useful lives. They are initially
measured at acquisition cost and subsequently amortized based on the expected consumption of
economic benefits over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years.
Judgment is required in determining the following:
"– The useful life of an intangible asset, as this is based on our estimates regarding the period over"
which the intangible asset is expected to generate economic benefits to us
"– The amortization method, as IFRS requires the straight-line method to be used unless we can"
reliably determine the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be
consumed by us
Both the amortization period and the amortization method have an impact on the amortization
expense that is recorded in each period.

Classification of Intangibles
We classify intangible assets according to their nature and use in our operations. Software and
"database licenses consist primarily of technology for internal use, whereas acquired technology"
consists primarily of purchased software to be incorporated into our product offerings. Customer
relationships and other intangibles consist primarily of customer relationships and acquired trademark
licenses.
"Amortization expenses of intangible assets are classified as Cost of cloud, Cost of services, Research"
"and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administration, depending on the use of the"
respective intangible assets.
