work (input-based percentage-of-completion method). This method of measuring progress faithfully
"depicts the transfer of the development services to the customer, as substantially all of these costs"
are cost of the staff or third parties performing the development work. In estimating the total cost to
"fully complete the development work, we consider our history with similar projects."
"– For agreements that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future,"
"unspecific software products, we recognize revenue at a point in time for licenses that are made"
immediately accessible to the customer. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the
"software subscription contract for the unspecified software products, as our performance obligation"
is to stand ready to deliver such products on a when-and-if-available basis.
Software support revenue is typically recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the
"term of the support arrangement. Under our standardized support services, our performance"
"obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support and unspecified updates, upgrades,"
and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. Our customers simultaneously receive and
consume the benefits of these support services as we perform.
Service revenue is typically recognized over time. Where we stand ready to provide the service (such
"as access to learning content), we recognize revenue based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the"
service period. Consumption-based services (such as separately identifiable consulting services and
premium support services and classroom training services) are recognized over time as the services
"are utilized, typically following the percentage-of-completion method or ratably. When using the"
"percentage-of-completion method, we typically measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of"
the performance obligation in the same way and with the same reasoning and judgment as we do for
customer-specific on-premise software development agreements. We apply judgment in determining
whether a service qualifies as a stand-ready service or as a consumption-based service.
Revenue for combined performance obligations is recognized over the longest period of all promises
in the combined performance obligation.
Judgment is also required in determining whether revenue is to be recognized at a point in time or
"over time. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we need to measure progress using the"
method that best reflects SAP’s performance. When using cost incurred as a measure of progress for
"recognizing revenue over time, we apply judgment in estimating the total cost to satisfy the"
performance obligation.
All of the judgments and estimates mentioned above can significantly impact the timing and amount of
revenue to be recognized.
Contract Balances
We recognize trade receivables for performance obligations satisfied over time gradually as the
performance obligation is satisfied and in full once the invoice is due. Judgment is required in
determining whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable.
Contract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due or payments received in advance of revenue
recognition.
"Typically, we invoice fees for on-premise standard software on contract closure and software delivery."
"Periodic fixed fees for cloud subscription services, software support services, and other multi-period"
agreements are typically invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance. Such fee prepayments account for
the majority of our contract liability balance. Fees based on actual transaction volumes for cloud
subscriptions and fees charged for non-periodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered.
"While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type and region, our terms typically require"
payment within 30 to 60 days.
