SAP Health & Safety Commitment Statement
"At SAP, we offer a wide range of health and well-"
"being services to our employees, ranging from"
general guidance on how to be more active and to
deal with stress and challenging situations in- and
"outside SAP, conducting health and people days,"
consultation on ergonomic workplace set-up to
"prevent back pain, to local vaccination initiatives."
Employees have access to these services and are
informed about them in SAPâ€™s internal employee
"portal, monthly newsletters, live sessions, and"
"campaigns, or by contacting the SAP Health team"
"directly. In addition, we have Web-based tools such"
as the SAP Health Navigator which guides SAP
people toward health offerings and tips according
to their individual needs. The Run Your Way program
on our Fit@SAP activity challenge platform
encourages people to integrate more physical
activity into their daily life.
Please also refer to GRI 2-8.
"As outlined in GRI 403-2, we have various"
approaches to identify negative occupational health
and safety impacts such as the BHCI and Country
Health Dashboard as well as various channels to
"report concerns and incidents. In addition, to ensure"
"the health, safety, and well-being of our employees"
"worldwide, SAP runs dedicated crises management"
and business continuity frameworks. To safeguard
"our people on business travels, SAP ensures"
medical and security assistance through a Travel
Assistance Program.
Fatalities and injuries are not a material issue for
"SAP, as most of our employees work in an office"
environment. Please refer to GRI 3-3 for the main
types of work-related ill health.
The identification of work-related hazards that pose
a risk of ill health (such as via the BHCI or the Run
"Healthy program), as well the actions taken to"
"eliminate/ minimize these hazards and risks, are"
outlined in GRI 403-1 to GRI 403-7.
"Internally, we track and monitor an SAP illness rate"
(in %) which is defined as the total number of days
absent (including absences shorter than 3 days) /
scheduled workdays per year (250 days) x 100. In
"2023, SAP had a global illness rate of 2.1%.89 We do"
not break the illness rate down into different
categories due to the low risk of specifically work-
"related illnesses. Therefore, we only track an overall"
illness rate.
"In 2023, our Stress Satisfaction Score evaluation"
(see GRI 403-2) confirmed lower stress levels on
"average compared to satisfaction. Furthermore, we"
leverage the company reports from our external
Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providers to
recognize health trends and to derivate appropriate
actions.
"For non-employee workers, we require our suppliers"
and sub-suppliers to uphold health and safety
standards via our Global Supplier Code of Conduct.
"In addition, in Germany we have safety Instructions"
for contractors in place.
Please also refer to GRI 2-8.
