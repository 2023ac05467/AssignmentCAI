Costs to Fulfill Customer Contracts
Capitalized costs incurred to fulfill customer contracts mainly consist of direct costs for set-up and
implementation of cloud products and custom cloud development contracts as far as these costs are
not in scope of other accounting standards than IFRS 15. These costs are amortized after completion
"of the setup and implementation or the development, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the"
expected life of the cloud subscription contract including expected renewals. For the life of the
"contract, we consider our expectation about future contract renewals which we evaluate periodically"
to confirm that the resulting amortization period properly reflects the expected contract life. The
"amortization periods range from five to eight years depending on the type of offering. In addition, the"
capitalized costs include third-party license fees which are amortized over the term of the third-party
license contract. Judgment is required in evaluating whether costs are directly related to customer
contracts and in estimating contract lives.
Amortization of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts for custom cloud applications and extensions is
included in the cost of cloud.
