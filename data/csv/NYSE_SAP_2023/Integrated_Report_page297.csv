"In 2023, we had on average 999 workers87 who were not employees"
and whose work was controlled by SAP. GRI’s definition matches
SAP’s external workforce category “temporary staff.”
"Temporary staff are all contracted through a recruitment agency, with a"
contract in line with country specific legislation.
This external workforce is deployed to act as a replacement employee
"for a limited period of time, provide a specialist skill on a short-term"
"basis, or cover temporary peaks in work. The performed work is"
equivalent to that done by employees and spans all types of roles in
the business.
"Temporary staff has access to our Health, Safety & Well-Being"
"offerings. However, we do not include temporary staff into our Health,"
Safety & Well-Being-related KPIs due to data collection boundaries.

Report by the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is informed regularly and on an ad-hoc basis by
the Executive Board about the Company’s strategy and the status of its
"implementation, business planning, profitability, and all aspects of"
"business performance which are material for the SAP Group, including"
"any deviations of actual business performance from plan, and about"
"current risks, risk management, and corporate compliance. In addition,"
the Executive Board involves the Supervisory Board in decisions on
"matters of fundamental importance for the Company, including in case"
of transactions requiring the Supervisory Board’s prior consent. The
"Supervisory Board’s activities of the previous year, including its"
"decisions on transactions requiring its prior consent, are described in"
detail in the Report by the Supervisory Board for the relevant fiscal
"year, which is included in SAP’s Integrated Report. Due to the"
overlapping and not always sharply delineated nature of matters
"discussed, disclosing a total number of critical concerns would not be"
accurate. We provide transparency qualitatively through the Report by
the Supervisory Board.
